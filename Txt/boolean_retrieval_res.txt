    "abstract": "We explore binary asteroid formation by spin-up and rotational disruption considering the NASA DART mission's encounter with the Didymos-Dimorphos binary, which was the first 
small binary visited by a spacecraft. Using a suite of $N$-body simulations, we follow the gravitational accumulation of a satellite from meter-sized particles following a mass-shedding event 
from a rapidly rotating primary. The satellite's formation is chaotic, as it undergoes a series of collisions, mergers, and close gravitational encounters with other moonlets, leading to a wide range of outcomes in terms of the satellite's mass, shape, orbit, and rotation state. We find that a Dimorphos-like satellite can form rapidly, in a matter of days, following a realistic mass-shedding event in which only ${\\sim}2-3\\%$ of the primary's mass is shed. Satellites can form in synchronous rotation due to their formation near the Roche limit. There is a strong preference for forming prolate (elongated) satellites, although some simulations result in oblate spheroids like Dimorphos. The distribution of simulated secondary shapes is broadly consistent with other binary systems, measured through radar or lightcurves. Unless Dimorphos's shape is an outlier, and considering the observational bias against lightcurve-based determination of secondary elongations for oblate bodies, we suggest there could be a significant population of oblate secondaries. If these satellites initially form with elongated shapes, a yet-unidentified pathway is 
needed to explain how they become oblate. Finally, we show that this chaotic formation pathway occasionally forms asteroid pairs and stable triples, including co-orbital satellites and satellites in mean motion resonances.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis based on the standard model only and explaining the coincidence between the baryon and dark matter densities in the Universe, as well as the observed value of the baryon-to-photon ratio. In our scenario, large curvature fluctuations slightly below the threshold for Primordial Black Hole (PBH) formation locally reheat the plasma above the sphaleron barrier when they collapse gravitationally but without forming a black hole. This rapid process can lead to a maximal baryogenesis in those regions at the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) epoch at thermal temperatures between 20 MeV and 50 MeV. Compared to another mechanism relying on shock waves associated to the formation of PBHs, our mechanism instead applies to aborted PBHs. Using simulations in numerical relativity, we calculate the overdensity threshold for baryogenesis and show that the baryon-to-photon ratio is generically between two and three times larger than the relative abundance of PBHs formed at those temperatures. Finally, we show that PBH formation models at the QCD epoch leading to an abundance comparable to the dark matter could have generated a baryon density and an averaged baryon-to-photon ratio consistent with observations.",

We find that both drag and gravity play an important role in the evolution of large dust grains. If we include both, grains that would otherwise be partially decoupled will become well coupled and trace the spirals. For the dust grains most influenced by drag 
(with Stokes numbers near unity), the dust disc quickly becomes gravitationally unstable and rapidly forms clumps with masses between 0.15 - 6 Earth masses. A large fraction of clumps are below the threshold where runaway gas accretion can occur. However, if dust self-gravity is neglected, the dust is unable to form clumps, despite still becoming trapped in the gas spirals. When large dust grains are unable to feel either gas gravity or drag, the dust is unable to trace the gas spirals. Hence, full physics is needed to properly simulate dust in gravitationally unstable 
discs.\nDust trapping of large grains in spiral arms of discs stable to gas fragmentation could explain planet formation in very young discs by a population of planetesimals formed due to the

    "abstract": "We study the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) from density fluctuations due to supercooled phase transitions (PTs) triggered in an axion-like particle (ALP) model. We find that the mass of the PBHs is inversely correlated with the ALP decay constant $f_a$. For instance, for $f_a$ varying from ${\\cal O}$(100 MeV) to ${\\cal O}$($10^{12}$ GeV), the PBH mass varies between $(10^{3} - 10^{-24}) M_{\\odot}$. We then identify the ALP parameter space where the PBH can account for the entire (or partial) dark matter fraction of the Universe, in a single (multi-component) dark matter scenario, with the ALP being the other dark matter candidate. The PBH parameter space ruled out by current cosmological and microlensing observations can thus be directly mapped onto the ALP parameter space, thus providing new bounds on ALPs, complementary to the laboratory and astrophysical ALP constraints. Similarly, depending on the ALP couplings to other Standard Model particles, the ALP constraints on $f_a$ can be translated into a lower bound on the PBH mass scale. Moreover, the supercooled PT leads to a potentially observable stochastic gravitational wave (GW) signal at future GW observatories, such as aLIGO, LISA and ET, that acts as another complementary probe of the ALPs, as well as of the PBH dark matter. Finally, we show that the recent NANOGrav signal of stochastic GW in the nHz frequency range can be explained in our model with $f_a\\simeq (10~{\\rm GeV}-1~{\\rm TeV})$.",

    "abstract": "We report on recent progress in the development of Laue lenses for applications in hard X/soft gamma-ray astronomy. Here we focus on the realization of a sector of such a lens made of 11 bent Germanium crystals and describe the technological challenges involved in their positioning and alignment with adhesive-based bonding techniques. The accurate alignment and the uniformity of the curvature of the crystals are critical for achieving optimal X-ray focusing capabilities. We have assessed how the errors of misalignment with respect to the main orientation angles of the crystals affect the point spread function (PSF) of the image diffracted by a single sector. We have corroborated these results with simulations carried out with our physical model of the lens, based on a Monte Carlo ray-tracing technique, adopting the geometrical configuration of the Laue sector, the observed assembly accuracy and the measured curvatures of the crystals. An extrapolation of the performances achieved on a single sector to an entire Laue lens based on this model has shown that a PSF with half-power-diameter of 4.8 arcmin can be achieved with current technology. This has the potential to lead to a significant improvement in sensitivity of spectroscopic and polarimetric observations in the 50-600 keV band",
