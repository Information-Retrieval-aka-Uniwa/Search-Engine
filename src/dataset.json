        "abstract": "From transmission electron microscopy and other laboratory studies of presolar grains, the implicit condensation sequence of carbon-bearing condensates in circumstellar envelopes of carbon stars is (from first to last) TiC-graphite-SiC. We use thermochemical equilibrium condensation calculations and show that the condensation sequence of TiC, graphite, and SiC depends on metallicity in addition to C/O ratio and total pressure. Calculations were performed for a characteristic carbon star ratio of C/O = 1.2 from 1E-10 to 1E-4 bars total pressure and for uniform metallicity variations ranging from 0.01 to 100 times solar elemental abundances. TiC always condenses before SiC, and the carbide condensation temperatures increase with increasing metallicity and total pressure. Graphite, however, can condense in a cooling circumstellar envelope before TiC, between TiC and SiC, or after SiC, depending on the carbon-bearing gas chemistry, which is dependent on metallicity and total pressure. Analytical expressions for the graphite, TiC, and SiC condensation temperatures as functions of metallicity and total pressure are presented. The inferred sequence from laboratory presolar grain studies, TiC-graphite-SiC, is favored under equilibrium conditions at solar and subsolar metallicities between ~1E-5 to 1E-8 bar total pressure within circumstellar envelopes of carbon stars with nominal C/O = 1.2. We also explored the dependence of the sequence at C/O ratios of 1.1 and 3.0 and found that as the C/O ratio increases, the TiC-graphite-SiC region shifts towards higher total pressures and lower metallicities.",

However, both QM/MM and QM/cDFT rely on approximations that introduce ambiguities. This series of papers aims to establish a rigorous theoretical framework to guide the development of a QM/cDFT formulation that clarifies the approximations involved. In this first paper, we establish a comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) framework for mixed quantum (QM)-classical (MM) systems within the canonical ensemble. We derive the equilibrium density matrix for a system comprising N qm QM and N mm MM particles and, based on this derivation, propose a variational formulation of the Helmholtz free energy in terms of the full QM-MM density matrix. By leveraging permutational symmetry and thanks to constrained-search methods, we reformulate the variational problem using functionals of objects having reduced dimensionalities. Three different formulations are presented, each using quantities with progressively lower dimensionalities. This ultimately enables computation of the Helmholtz free energy using only the QM and MM one-body densities, generalizing both cDFT and electronic DFT (eDFT) for QM-MM systems. In a subsequent paper, this formalism will be extended to the grand canonical ensemble, allowing classical particle number fluctuations. This extension, in which cDFT is most naturally formulated, provides a framework for studying solvation problems.",

        "abstract": "Sapphire is an attractive material in photonic, optoelectronic, and transparent ceramic applications that stand to benefit from surface functionalization effects stemming from micro/nanostructures. Here we investigate the use of ultrafast lasers for fabricating nanostructures in sapphire by exploring the relationship between irradiation parameters, morphology change, and selective etching. In this approach an ultrafast laser pulse is focused on the sapphire substrate to change the crystalline morphology to amorphous or polycrystalline, which is characterized by examining different vibrational modes using Raman spectroscopy. The irradiated regions are then removed using a subsequent wet etch in hydrofluoric acid. Laser confocal measurements conducted before and after the etching process quantify the degree of selective etching. The results indicate that a threshold laser pulse intensity is required for selective etching to occur. This process can be used to fabricate hierarchical sapphire nanostructures over large areas with enhanced hydrophobicity, which exhibits an apparent contact angle of 140 degrees and a high roll-off angle that are characteristic of the rose petal effect. Additionally, the fabricated structures have high broadband diffuse transmittance of up to 81.8% with low loss, which can find applications in optical diffusers. Our findings provide new insights into the interplay between the light-matter interactions, where Raman shifts associated with different vibrational modes can be used as a predictive measure of selective etching. These results advance the development of sapphire nanostructure fabrication, which can find applications in infrared optics, protective windows, and consumer electronics.",

        "abstract": "Tuning the density of resident electrons or holes in semiconductors provides crucial insight into the composition of excitonic complexes that are observed as absorption or photoluminescence resonances in optical studies. Moreover, we can change the way these resonances shift and broaden in energy by controlling the quantum numbers of the resident carriers with magnetic fields and doping levels, and by selecting the quantum numbers of the photoexcited or recombining electron-hole (e-h) pair through optical polarization. We discuss the roles of distinguishability and optimality of excitonic complexes, showing them to be key ingredients that determine the energy shifts and broadening of optical resonances in charge-tunable semiconductors. A distinguishable e-h pair means that the electron and hole undergoing photoexcitation or recombination have quantum numbers that are not shared by any of the resident carriers. An optimal excitonic complex refers to a complex whose particles come with all available quantum numbers of the resident carriers. All optical resonances may be classified as either distinct or indistinct depending on the distinguishability of the e-h pair, and the underlying excitonic complex can be classified as either optimal or suboptimal. The universality of these classifications, inherited from the fundamental Pauli exclusion principle, allows us to understand how optical resonances shift in energy and whether they should broaden as doping is increased. This understanding is supported by conclusive evidence that the decay of optical resonances cannot be simply attributed to enhanced screening when resident carriers are added to a semiconductor. Finally, applying the classification scheme in either monolayer or moire heterobilayer systems, we relate the energy shift and amplitude of the neutral exciton resonance to the compressibility of the resident carrier gas.",

        "abstract": "The continued miniaturization of semiconductor devices, represented by Moore's law, has reached the atomic scale limit, requiring nanoscale quantum mechanical effects to be included in device simulations without empirical parameters. For this purpose, a method that combines density functional theory (DFT) and non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) theory has been established as the standard approach for atomic-scale device simulations. However, the DFT-NEGF scheme has several inherent weaknesses due to the underlying Landauer or grand canonical viewpoint. To overcome these challenges, over the years, we have developed an alternative approach, the multi-space constrained-search DFT (MS-DFT) formalism. The central starting point of this development is the replacement of the Landauer picture by the multi-space excitation viewpoint or the mapping of the quantum transport process to the energy- and position-space electron excitation within a (micro)canonical ensemble device model. This change in the viewpoint leads to several fundamental advantages of MS-DFT over its DFT-NEGF counterparts, such as the variational determination of non-equilibrium total energy, the explicit extraction of quasi-Fermi level distributions, and the possibility of faithfully modeling finite 2D electrodes. In this article, we highlight the key features and applications of the MS-DFT formalism.",

The appearance of few-cycle light sources available from the visible to the mid-infrared spectral range and the development of attosecond extreme ultraviolet and x-ray technologies provide for the first time the possibility to directly observe and control ultrafast electron dynamics in matter on their natural time scale. However, few-fs sources have hardly been available in the deep ultraviolet (DUV; 4-6 eV, 300-200 nm) and are unavailable in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV; 6-12 eV, 200-100 nm) spectral range, corresponding to the photon energies required for valence excitation of atoms and molecules. Here, we generate VUV pulses with $\u03bc$J energy tunable between 160 and 190 nm via resonant dispersive wave emission during soliton self-compression in a capillary. We fully characterize the pulses in situ using frequency-resolved optical gating based on two-photon photoionization in noble gases. The measurements reveal that in most of the cases the pulses are shorter than 3 fs. These findings unlock the potential to investigate ultrafast electron dynamics with a time-resolution that has been hitherto inaccessible when using VUV pulses.",

While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results in simulated environments, discrepancies between simulations and real-world conditions have limited its practical deployment. This study introduces an innovative control framework that integrates trajectory optimization with drift maneuvers, aiming to improve the algorithm's adaptability for real-vehicle implementation. We leveraged Bezier-based pre-trajectory optimization to enhance rewards and optimize the controller through Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) in a simulated environment. For real-world deployment, we implement a hybrid RL-MPC fusion mechanism, , where TD3-derived maneuvers serve as primary inputs for a Model Predictive Controller (MPC). This integration enables precise real-time tracking of the optimal trajectory, with MPC providing corrective inputs to bridge the gap between simulation and reality. The efficacy of this method is validated through real-vehicle tests on consumer-grade electric vehicles, focusing on drift U-turns and drift right-angle turns. The control outcomes of these real-vehicle tests are thoroughly documented in the paper, supported by supplementary video evidence (https://youtu.be/5wp67FcpfL8). Notably, this study is the first to deploy and apply an RL-based transient drift cornering algorithm on consumer-grade electric vehicles.",

These results constitute a turning point, not only for dark matter searches that are now entering the \\textit{neutrino fog}, but they also bring out new opportunities to exploit dark matter facilities as neutrino detectors. We investigate the implications of recent data from the PandaX-4T and XENONnT experiments on both Standard Model physics and new neutrino interactions. We first extract information on the weak mixing angle at low momentum transfer. Then, following a phenomenological approach, we consider Lorentz-invariant interactions (scalar, vector, axial-vector, and tensor) between neutrinos, quarks and charged leptons. Furthermore, we study the $U(1)_\\mathrm{B-L}$ scenario as a concrete example of a new anomaly-free vector interaction. We find that despite the low statistics of these first experimental results, the inferred bounds are in some cases already competitive. For the scope of this work we also compute new bounds on some of the interactions using CE$\u03bd$NS data from COHERENT and electron recoil data from XENONnT, LUX-ZEPLIN, PandaX-4T, and TEXONO. It seems clear that while direct detection experiments continue to take data, more precise measurements will be available, thus allowing to test new neutrino interactions at the same level or even improving over dedicated neutrino facilities.",

Here, we reveal that a localized trapping potential powerful enough to pull in the vortex line can be created with nanoscale precision on the surface of an FeSe superconductor using the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope. The mechanism of tip-induced force is traced to local modification of electronic properties and reduction of the superconducting gap, most likely due to tip-induced strain. Intriguingly, the tip-induced trapping potential is much less pronounced along the twin boundaries, dramatically reducing the vortice's degree of motion relative to the surrounding lattice. By enabling nanoscale manipulation of single vortices in Fe-based superconductors, and likely similar materials with strong strain-susceptibility of the superconducting gap, our findings provide an important step toward further development of vortex-based quantum information processing.",

We characterize the magnetic field near the edges produced by both electron currents and spin accumulation at the edge. We focus on identifying the position from the edge at which the effects of spin accumulation become detectable. We observe that a larger gap between the conduction and valence bands, along with a lower Fermi velocity, results in a stronger magnetic field, with the detectable spin accumulation being more concentrated near the edge. Conversely, a smaller gap results in a slight reduction in the magnetic field magnitude, but the field associated with spin accumulation becomes detectable further from the edge.

The approach maps the valley Hamiltonian to a Landau-Zener problem to model the nonadiabatic dynamics in regions of small valley splitting. An optimization refines the shuttling velocity profile over a single small segment of the shuttling path. The protocol reliably returns the valley state to the ground state at the end of the shuttle, disentangling the spin and valley degrees of freedom, after which a single virtual $z$-rotation on the spin compensates its evolution during the shuttle. The time cost and complexity of the error suppression is minimal and independent of the distance over which the spin is shuttled, and the maximum velocities imposed by valley physics are found to be orders of magnitude larger than current experimentally achievable shuttling speeds. This protocol offers a chip-scale solution for high-fidelity quantum transport in silicon spin-based quantum computing devices.",

        "abstract": "Molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) is a high-potential material for nanoelectronic applications, especially when thinned to a few layers. Liquid phase exfoliation enables large-scale fabrication of thin films comprising single- and few-layer flakes of MoS$_2$ or other transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), exhibiting variations in flake size, geometry, edge terminations, and overlapping areas. Electronic conductivity of such films is thus determined by two contributions: the intraflake conductivity, reflecting the value of each single layer, and charge transport across these overlapping flakes. Employing first-principles simulations, we investigate the influence of various edge terminations and of the overlap between flakes on the charge transport in MoS$_2$ film models. We identify characteristic electronic edge states originating from the edge atoms and their chemical environment, which resemble donor and acceptor states of doped semiconductors. This makes either electrons or holes to majority carriers and enables selective control over the dominant charge carrier type (n-type or p-type). Compared to pristine nanosheets, overlapping flakes exhibit lower overall conductance. In the best performing hexagonal flakes occurring in Mo-rich environments, the conductance is reduced by 20% compared to the pristine layer, while the drop by 40%, and 50% is predicted for truncated triangular, and triangular flakes, respectively in S-rich environments. An overlap of 6.5 nm is sufficient to achieve the highest possible interflake conductance. These findings allow for a rational optimization of experimental conditions for the preparation of MoS$_2$ and other TMDC semiconducting thin films.",

To compete with conventional electronics, universal and fast methods for controlling and reading the valley quantum number of electrons have to be developed. Addressing the inequivalent conduction band valleys based on optical selection rules has been demonstrated in two-dimensional crystals with broken time-reversal symmetry. However, selective optical manipulation with electron populations in inequivalent valleys has not been possible in many technologically important semiconductor materials that possess multiple conduction band minima, including silicon and diamond. Here we demonstrate an ultrafast technique allowing to generate and read valley polarized population of electrons in bulk semiconductors on sub-picosecond time scales. The principle is based on unidirectional intervalley scattering of electrons accelerated by oscillating electric field of linearly polarized infrared femtosecond pulses. The degree of valley polarization is measured via polarization anisotropy of Drude absorption of a delayed infrared probe pulse allowing us to directly characterize intervalley scattering times in silicon and diamond at different temperatures. Our results pave the way towards room temperature valleytronic devices working at terahertz frequencies that will be compatible with contemporary silicon-based technology.",

        "abstract": "Decades ago, Sondheimer discovered that the electric conductivity of metallic crystals hosting ballistic electrons oscillates with magnetic field. These oscillations, periodic in magnetic field and the period proportional to the sample thickness, have been understood in a semi-classical framework. Here, we present a study of longitudinal and transverse conductivity in cadmium single crystals with thickness varying between 12.6 to 475 $\u03bc$m. When the magnetic field is sufficiently large or the sample sufficiently thick, the amplitude of oscillation falls off as $B^{-4}$ as previously reported. In contrast, the ten first oscillations follow a $B^{-2.5}e^{-B/B_0}$ field dependence and their amplitude is set by the quantum of conductance, the sample thickness, the magnetic length and the Fermi surface geometry. We demonstrate that they are beyond the semi-classical picture, as the exponential prefactor indicates quantum tunneling between distinct quantum states. We draw a picture of these quantum oscillations, in which the linear dispersion of the semi-Dirac band in the cadmium plays a crucial role. The oscillations arise by the intersection between the lowest Landau tube and flat toroids on the Fermi surface induced by confinement. Positive and negative corrections to semi-classical magneto-conductance can occur by alternation between destructive and constructive interference in phase-coherent helical states. The quantum limit of Sondheimer oscillations emerges as another manifestation of Aharanov-Bohm flux quantization.",

We demonstrate that the dichotomy between the linear and quadratic dispersions is driven by an orientation-sensitive hybridization between the $s$ and $p_z$ orbitals. The upper semi-Dirac band produces a lens-shaped nonellipsoidal Fermi sheet whose cross-section area has a $k$-dependence that is in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured period of Sondheimer oscillations.",

Therein, LLMs are provided with a set of requirements and a textual system specification and are prompted to assess which requirements are fulfilled by the system specification. Different experimental variables such as system specification complexity, the number of requirements, and prompting strategies were analyzed. Formal rule-based systems serve as a benchmark to compare LLM performance to. Requirements and system specifications are derived from the smart-grid domain. Results show that advanced LLMs, like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, achieved f1-scores between 79 % and 94 % in identifying non-fulfilled requirements, indicating potential for LLMs to be leveraged for requirements verification.",

It is shown that bipolar pulses can predominantly generate particles with ultrarelativistic velocities along the propagation direction of the pulses, while unipolar ones are generally more favorable in terms of the total particle yield in the same regime. The highly nontrivial properties of the $e^+e^-$ spectra revealed in our study provide strong experimental signatures paving the way to probe a complex vacuum response within the short-time domain of quantum electrodynamics.",

Parametric optimization of the different laser and plasma parameters performed show that, laser pulse as short as L/lambda_P~0.42 is most stably guided upto few Rayleigh lengths for normalized laser intensity, a0~0.9. Next effect of upward density ramps were also studied and it was found that inclusion of an upward density ramp not only enhances self-focusing and guiding of the ultra-short laser pulse but also reduces required minimum laser intensity compared to uniform density profile.",

However, current works are limited to basic sign understanding without considering the egocentric vehicle's spatial position, which fails to support further regulation assessment and direction navigation. Following the above issues, we introduce a new task: traffic sign interpretation from the vehicle's first-person view, referred to as TSI-FPV. Meanwhile, we develop a traffic guidance assistant (TGA) scenario application to re-explore the role of traffic signs in ADS as a complement to popular autonomous technologies (such as obstacle perception). Notably, TGA is not a replacement for electronic map navigation; rather, TGA can be an automatic tool for updating it and complementing it in situations such as offline conditions or temporary sign adjustments. Lastly, a spatial and semantic logic-aware stepwise reasoning pipeline (SignEye) is constructed to achieve the TSI-FPV and TGA, and an application-specific dataset (Traffic-CN) is built. Experiments show that TSI-FPV and TGA are achievable via our SignEye trained on Traffic-CN. The results also demonstrate that the TGA can provide complementary information to ADS beyond existing popular autonomous technologies.",

Due to the low lattice constant of LAO/STO, approximately 0.394 nm, these calculations become extremely time-consuming.

The scaled model is analyzed within the context of quantum transport simulations and electronic structure calculations. Our findings demonstrate that the scaled model closely aligns with the ordinary one up to a scaling factor of 8.

Commonly, ferroic phases emerge from descending symmetry-breaking, as the laws of thermodynamics dictate that the ordered low entropy phases form at low temperature, which limits practical applications of many materials at room temperature. Rare examples of ascending symmetry-breakings have been observed, but the driving force remains often unclear. Here, we report on a ferroelastic symmetry-breaking occurring at high temperature in a spin-crossover material, studied by magnetic, DSC and X-ray diffraction measurements. Our DFT calculations and our model, based on the Landau theory of phase transitions, explain how the cooperative thermal switching of molecular spin state drives a ferroelastic symmetry breaking at high temperature, through a coupled Jahn-Teller distortion. Ferroelastic materials have rich properties, with important applications in memory, multifunctional and novel controllable devices. The electronic bistability in soft functional materials represents an important source of entropy gain, capable of overcoming the cost of symmetry-breaking entropy, which opens up new perspectives for stabilizing high-temperature and low-symmetry ferroic functions of advanced materials",

It is observed that the MgTe possesses room temperature hole and electron mobility of 18.7 cm2/Vs and 335 cm2/Vs, respectively; in contrast to this, the bulk MgSe follows reverse trend in temperature dependent carrier mobilities owing to its different scattering rate and electron-phonon coupling profiles. The key feature of the study was to showcase the importance of electron-phonon coupling in determining the carrier mobility and the relative dynamics in the material. Further, the incorporation of e-p coupling softens the electronic and phonon dispersions which is subjected to the inclusion of the interaction between the electrons and the phonons of the systems. The overall results indicate that the incorporation of the electron-phonon coupling is crucial in determining the carrier dynamics of the system which is in excellent agreement with the experimental findings. Both materials possess moderate magnitudes of mobilities that are subjected to the modification by means of changing the dimensional confinement and/or chemical composition that can strongly influence the carrier dynamics by means of altered edge states and coupling parameters.",

This response is highly dependent on the underlying crystal symmetries in the material and is typically smaller than the linear responses. Nonlinear responses are therefore usually employed to expose the symmetry breaking, geometric properties of the electronic band structure in materials. Naturally, a material system with a strong nonlinear response is also the key component in nonlinear devices. Here we report the strong room-temperature second-harmonic transport response in a quantum magnet,TbMn6Sn6, which is governed by the quantum metric and can be tuned with applied magnetic fields and temperature. We show that around room temperature, which is close to the spontaneous spin-reorientation transition, the magnetic configurations, and therefore the related symmetry breaking phases, are easily controlled.

        "abstract": "Rhombohedral multilayer graphene has emerged as an extraordinary platform for investigating exotic quantum states, such as superconductivity and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects, mainly due to the existence of topological surface flatbands. Despite extensive research efforts, a systematic spectroscopic investigation on the evolution of its electronic structure from thin layers to bulk remains elusive. Using state-of-the-art angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with submicron spatial resolution, we directly probe and trace the thickness evolution of the topological electronic structures of rhombohedral multilayer graphene. As the layer number increases, the gapped subbands transform into the 3D Dirac nodes that spirals in the momentum space; while the flatbands are constantly observed around Fermi level, and eventually evolve into the topological drumhead surface states. This unique thickness-dependent topological phase transition can be well captured by the 3D generalization of 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain in thin layers, to the topological Dirac nodal spiral semimetal in the bulk limit. Our findings establish a solid foundation for exploring the exotic quantum phases with nontrivial topology and correlation effects in rhombohedral multilayer graphene.",

Model systems provide a controlled environment to investigate such phenomena, effectively. In this study, we employ first-principle calculations based on density functional theory and Green's function (GF) method to explore the impact of chemical structure on the sign and magnitude of exchange coupling, systematically. By designing model systems with bcc-Fe bulk doped with nonmagnetic X= (H, B, C, N, O, and F) atoms, we examine the effects of different ligands on the behavior of Fe-Fe exchange coupling, and demonstrate that the chemical environment surrounding the metal atom significantly influences the Fe-Fe exchange coupling. Our results highlight the tunability of exchange coupling based on Fe-dopant bond length(s), where the nature of ligand atoms and their electron correlation play a crucial role. This work illuminates the complex relationship between structure, and magnetism in magnetic materials, providing insights into the development of high-performance magnetic materials.",

All the three issues can be addressed at once by extending the SM with two generations of vector-like fermions and an inert scalar doublet, all odd under a Z2 symmetry. The light neutrino masses and mixings are generated radiatively while maintaining consistency with bounds on lepton flavor violation. Loop diagrams with the very same fields also serve to explain the anomalous magnetic moments. Similarly, the correct dark matter relic abundance is reproduced without coming into conflict with direct detection constraints, or those from big bang nucleosynthesis or the cosmic microwave observations. Finally, prospective signatures at the LHC are discussed.",

        "abstract": "The radiation physics of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains an open question. Based on the simulation analysis and recent observations, it was proposed that GRB jets are composed of a narrow ultra-relativistic core surrounded by a wide sub-relativistic cocoon. We show that emission from the synchrotron radiations and the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) process of shear-accelerated electrons in the mixed jet-cocoon (MJC) region and internal-shock-accelerated electrons in the jet core is potentially explained the spectral characteristics of the prompt gamma-rays. Assuming an exponential-decay velocity profile, the shear flow in the MJC region can accelerate electrons up to $\u03b3_{\\rm e,\\max} \\sim 10^4$ for injected electrons with $\u03b3_{\\rm e,inject}=3 \\times 10^2$, if its magnetic field strength ($B_{\\rm cn}$) is $100$ G and its inner-edge velocity ($\u03b2_{\\rm cn, 0}$) is 0.9c. The cooling of these electrons is dominated by the SSC process, and the emission flux peaks at the keV band. In addition, the energy flux of synchrotron radiations of internal-shock-accelerated electrons ($\u03b3_e=10^{4}\\sim 10^{5}$) peaks at around the keV$-$MeV band, assuming a bulk Lorentz factor of 300, a magnetic field strength of $\\sim 10^{6}$ G for the jet core. Adding the flux from both the jet core and the MJC region, the total spectral energy distribution (SED) illustrates similar characteristics as the broadband observations of GRBs. The bimodal and Band-Cut spectra observed in GRBs 090926A, 131108A, and 160509A can be well fit with our model. The derived $B_{\\rm cn}$ varies from 54 G to 450 G and $\u03b2_{\\rm cn,0}=0. 83\\sim 0.91$c.",

Monitoring SEPs and GCRs is critical to assess the lunar radiation environment in preparation for the return of humans to the Moon and to understand related radiation risks. As part of the Turkish Lunar Mission (TLM), a small acceptance particle detector is being developed to measure the albedo electron, proton, and heavy ion fluxes backscattered from the lunar surface. In low lunar orbit, the detector FoV will look at the Moon surface. The IRADCAL detectors consist of several layers, from top to down: a Multi-Layer Insulator (MLI); a thin plastic scintillator (S1) seen by four Silicon Photomultipliers (SIPMs), placed to form a cross on light guide surrounding the scintillator (S1); a 26x26x70 mm3 CsI(Tl) crystal scintillator (S2) and a thin crystal scintillator seen by four SIPMs (S3). The detector is designed to measure contained proton energy spectrum from 400 keV to 150 MeV, electron from 50 keV to 10 MeV and heavy ions (up to the CNO group) with energies up to 20 MeV/n. IRADCAL will provide two dE/dX values from two thin scintillators, Etot or dE/dX from thick scintillator, and dE/E ratios for particle identification. A multi-layer perceptron is being developed by using deep neural network algorithm to estimate the Depth of Interaction (DoI). S1 provides level 1 trigger and hit position, which, combined with DoI point, will help determine if a particle is escaping from the sides and to separate up/down-going particles. The thicker S3 will help identify whether the event is fully contained. It will fit in 2U CubeSat with 2.5 kg and 15 Watts of power required.",

In 1989, theorists hypothesized that this universality would manifest as scale-invariant behavior in the dynamic charge susceptibility, $\u03c7''(q,\u03c9)$. Here, we present momentum-resolved inelastic electron scattering measurements of the strange metal Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ showing that the susceptibility has the scale-invariant form $\u03c7''(q,\u03c9) = T^{-\u03bd} f(\u03c9/T)$, with exponent $\u03bd= 0.93$. We find the response is consistent with conformal invariance, meaning the dynamics may be thought of as occurring on a circle of radius $1/T$ in imaginary time, characterized by conformal dimension $\u0394= 0.05$. Our study indicates that the strange metal is a universal phenomenon whose properties are not determined by microscopic properties of a particular material.",

Here, we report the direct visualization of IVC order in RTG using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. Tuning the chemical potential through the Van Hove singularity near the edge of the valence band, we observe a cascade of phase transitions associated with the formation of half- and quarter-metal states. IVC phases, distinguished by an enlarged real space unit cell, are directly imaged near both the high- and low-density boundaries of the half-metal phase. At high hole density, we precisely reconstruct the IVC band structure through quasiparticle interference. Intriguingly, the charge density modulations reveal a C3-symmetric incommensurate IVC order that agrees with the recent prediction of an IVC-crystal phase. Our findings demonstrate that IVC phases are a widespread symmetry-broken ground state within graphene systems.",

This regime has become a venue for exciting discoveries such as the nonlinear Hall effect and diode-like nonreciprocal transport. However, interpretation of experimental data is challenging in the nonlinear regime as DC transport is described by a rank-3 conductivity tensor with 6 free parameters. Here, we resolve this challenge by analytically solving for the nonlinear potential distribution across the disk sample for an arbitrary linear and nonlinear conductivity tensors. This allows us to unambiguously extract all components of the nonlinear tensor from experimental measurement. Using this novel tool, we identify giant nonlinear Hall effect in Bernal bilayer graphene. Our methodology provides the first systematic framework for interpreting nonlinear transport and uncovers a new route towards understanding quasi-2D materials.",

This study provides new insights into the angular momentum transfer from field to particle in the scalar pair production process. It is expected that there are similar findings about vortex features for different spin alignment in electron-positron pair production in strong fields via the topology charge as a new freedom.",

        "abstract": "High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a nonlinear process in which a strong driving field interacts with a material, resulting in the frequency up-conversion of the driver into its high-order harmonics. This process is highly sensitive to the field's polarization: circular polarization, for instance, inhibits HHG. In this work, we demonstrate that the use of non-classical structured light enables HHG in this otherwise prohibitive configuration for classical drivers. In particular, we consider circularly polarized light with non-classical fluctuations, introduced via squeezing along one polarization direction, and show that the spectral properties of the emitted harmonics vary depending on the type of squeezing applied. Additionally, we examine the electron dynamics during HHG, revealing that non-classical fluctuations act as an effective force that guides the electron trajectories toward recombination. This approach opens new pathways for integrating quantum optics in HHG, providing novel means of controlling the light-matter interaction dynamics.",

These states have recently captured significant attention in various strongly correlated materials, where the breaking of translational or intra-unit-cell symmetries results in the emergence of pair density waves with wavelengths extending across one or multiple unit cells. Here, we employ a spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscope to identify robust half-unit-cell modulations of the superconducting gap magnitude, coherence strength and subgap states in tunable 1T$^{\\prime}$-MoTe$_2$ monolayer. The modulations are oriented perpendicular to the zigzag Mo chains and coexist with three-unit-cell primary pair density wave modulations along the Mo chains, both of which attenuate with increasing temperature and the application of external magnetic fields. Importantly, we find that the superconductivity modulations are strongly linked to unconventional electron pairing mechanisms, which significantly deviate from the Cooper pairing observed in traditional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconductors. Our results advance the knowledge of Cooper-pair density modulations and the intricate interplay with other symmetry-breaking states in strongly correlated superconductors.",

        "abstract": "Altermagnet is a class of antiferromagnets, which shows a staggered spin ordering with wave vector ${\\bm q}=0$, while its net magnetization is canceled out in the limit of zero relativistic spin-orbit coupling. The simplest case is when the up and down spins are ordered on two crystallographically equivalent sublattice sites within the unit cell that are not connected by translation, and consequently, the system breaks the macroscopic time-reversal symmetry. Accordingly, it exhibits non-relativistic spin splitting in the energy band and characteristic cross-correlation phenomena between spin, charge, and lattice (orbital) degrees of freedom. This is in contrast to conventional N\u00e9el-type antiferromagnets with ${\\bm q} \\neq 0$ conserving the macroscopic time-reversal symmetry, where the time-reversal operation flipping of spins combined with translation can make the system identical to the original state. Altermagneticsm is universally latent in various magnetic materials that have been considered as simple collinear-type antiferromagnets. In this article, we focus on perovskites with chemical formula {\\it ABX}$_3$, which are typical playgrounds for strongly correlated electron systems, and overview their altermagnetic aspects that have been overlooked in the past researches, based on microscopic model studies revealing the mechanisms of their properties. We display that a combination of a variety of antiferromagnetic ordering and the commonly-seen lattice distortions in perovskites gives rise to a non-relativistic spin splitting whose mechanism does not rely on the spin-orbit coupling and its consequent spin current generation, and the anomalous Hall effect in the presence of the spin-orbit coupling.",

Utilizing a partitioning method based on equal (or unequal) probabilities -- without incorporating the alpha-cluster ($\u03b1$-cluster) model -- allows for the derivation of diverse topological configurations of nuclear fragments resulting from fragmentation. Subsequently, we predict the multiplicity distribution of nuclear fragments for specific excited nuclei, such as $^9$Be$^*$, $^{12}$C$^*$, and $^{16}$O$^*$, which can be produced in electron-nucleus ($eA$) collisions at the forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). According to the $\u03b1$-cluster model, an $\u03b1$-cluster structure should take precedence among different internal structures; this may result in deviations in the multiplicity distributions of nuclear fragments with charge $Z=2$, compared to those predicted by the partitioning methods. The findings presented herein could serve as a reference for validating the existence of $\u03b1$-cluster structures.",

However, the rise of new candidate materials and recent developments in measurement techniques have enabled us to discuss the possibilities of EI states in real materials experimentally. In this article, we review recent progress in the research of EIs. We start with an introduction to the theoretical background of the EI and the mechanism of the order formation including its relation to the physics of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) - Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover. We also review the EI states studied in the context of strongly correlated electron systems. Then, we introduce the candidate materials for the EI and the issues raised by recent experiments. For example, the phase transitions in several candidate materials are accompanied by lattice distortions, and the contributions from electron-lattice coupling hinder the identification of the excitonic entity. We also review the profiles of the collective modes to discuss the dynamical signatures of the EI.",

Here, we show the emergence of giant spin-orbit torque driven by 2D hole gas at the surface of hydrogen-terminated diamond, where the constituent substances are ubiquitous elements, carbon and hydrogen. The index of its spin torque efficiency at room temperature is several times greater than that of rare metal, Pt, the benchmark system/element for spin-to-charge conversion.

Here, we introduce a novel approach utilizing structured light to directly imprint spatial spin structures in a GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well. This method allows for the precise control over the wave number and configuration of the spin helices, overcoming the limitations of previous techniques. Experiments conducted using pump-probe Kerr rotation microscopy combined with a programmable spatial light modulator revealed the efficient and tunable generation of spin helices.

We argue that the leading intra-band contribution to electronic correlations are approximately 2D and come from Van Hove points at the projected $M$~points. By varying parameters around DFT values, we determine a phase diagram for the quasi-2D scenario as function of on-site and nearest-neighbor interactions. We discuss universal aspects in the electronic mechanisms for the resulting phases, as well as the role of SU(2) symmetry breaking. We find FeGe to be in a regime of strong competition between $p$-wave charge density wave, $f$-wave pairing, and $d$-wave spin Pomeranchuk instabilities. This interplay can be influenced in favor of superconducting pairing for slightly increased nearest-neighbor interaction, suggesting a potential to induce superconductivity in FeGe.",

For continuous systems like electron gas, this metric weighted by the density gives the momentum variance of electrons, which is readily measurable by ARPES.

If interconnected via radio frequency (RF) based wireless communication techniques, that being radiative, incur substantial absorption losses from the body during non-line-of-sight scenarios and consume higher power (more than 10s of mW). Although as a promising alternative with its non-radiative nature that resulted in 100X improvement in energy efficiency (sub-10 pJ/bit) and better signal confinement, Electro-Quasistatic Human Body Communication (EQS HBC) incurs moderate path loss (60-70 dB), limited data rate (less than 20 Mbps), making it less suitable for applications demanding fast connectivity like HD audio-video streaming, AR-VR-based products, distributed computing with wearable AI devices. Hence, to meet the requirement of energy-efficient connectivity at 100s of Mbps between wearables, we propose Body-Resonance (BR) HBC, which operates in the near-intermediate field and utilizes the transmission-line-like behavior of the body channel to offer 30X improvement in channel capacity. Our work sheds new light on the wireless communication system for wearables with potential to increase the channel gain by 20 dB with a 10X improvement in bandwidth compared to the EQS HBC for communication over on-body channels (whole-body coverage area). Experimentally demonstrating BR HBC, we presented low-loss (40-50 dB) and wide-band (hundreds of MHz) body channels that are 10X less leaky than radiative wireless communication, hence, can revolutionize the design of wireless communication system for several applications with wearables from healthcare, defense, to consumer electronics.",

Here, v_perp represents the electron velocity perpendicular to the background magnetic field. This formulation employs the maximum entropy method in velocity space using the Hankel transform, which converts from v_perp space to p space (where p is the index of the wavenumber in velocity space). Numerical tests validated the effectiveness of the proposed method, which is applicable across a wide range of magnetized plasma conditions, including conditions with both non-relativistic and relativistic electrons, except in cases of harmonic overlap or under optically thick conditions. Notably, this method does not require radiometer calibration for ECE measurements. This method fascilitates the experimental evaluation of electron entropy transport in fusion plasma experiments. Moreover, when combined with measurements in k-space (spatial distribution), this approach enables entropy distribution acquisition in phase space (k-p space).",

Based on a comprehensive comparison to experiments we first establish that inclusion of the U correction worsens the accuracy for the lattice constant. Consequently, PBE structures are used for subsequent property evaluations. The band gaps show significant dependence on the U-parameter. In particular, for 134 (21%) of the materials the U parameter leads to a metal-insulator transition. For the magnetic materials we calculate the magnetic moment, magnetic exchange coupling, and magnetic anisotropy parameters. In contrast to the band gaps, the size of the magnetic moments shows only weak dependence on U. Both the exchange energies and magnetic anisotropy parameters are systematically reduced by the U correction. On this basis we conclude that the Hubbard U correction will lead to lower predicted Curie temperatures in 2D materials. All the calculated properties are available in the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB).",

        "abstract": "We report an optical spectroscopy study of the charge-dynamics anisotropy in the La3Ni2O7 single crystals with the electric field of the incident light parallel to the crystalline c-axis and ab-plane respectively. The evolution of the low-energy part of its c-axis optical conductivity spectra (\u03c31c(\u03c9)) from a Drude component to a finite-energy peak, together with the change in the c-axis electron mean-free-path which is distinctly longer than the c-axis lattice constant at 10 K but is shorter than the c-axis lattice constant at 300 K, demonstrates a crossover from coherent to incoherent interlayer charge dynamics in La3Ni2O7, which is associated with the variation from weak to strong dissipation within its ab-plane. In contrast, the Drude component robust in its \u03c31ab(\u03c9) and the long ab-plane electron mean-free-path greater than the a-axis and b-axis unit-cell lengths manifest the persistence of coherent in-plane charge dynamics from 10 to 300 K. Thus, the charge dynamics in La3Ni2O7 shows a remarkable anisotropy at high temperatures. At low temperatures, the large values of the ratio between the ab-plane and c-axis Drude weights and the ratio \u03c31ab(\u03c9 -> 0)/\u03c31c(\u03c9 -> 0) indicate a strong anisotropy of the low-temperature charge dynamics in La3Ni2O7.",

The three-body correlation of impurity electrons contributes to the next-to-leading order terms of transport coefficients at low energies when the electron-hole symmetry, the time-reversal symmetries, or both are broken by external fields or potentials. Using the numerical renormalization group approach, we calculate the differential conductance and the nonlinear current noise through quantum dots, as well as the thermal conductivity of both quantum dots and magnetic alloys. Specifically, we focus on the SU(2) and SU(4) cases and demonstrate how the three-body contributions evolve in the limit of $U\\to\\infty$, across the $1/N$-filling Kondo regime and the valence fluctuation regime. Our results clarify how the three-body correlation affects low-energy transport, with a crucial dependence on the occupation number $N_d^{}$. We also show that the three-body correlation strongly couples with asymmetries in the tunnel couplings between quantum dots and reservoirs; in particular it significantly affects the nonlinear current through the quarter-filling Kondo state for $N=4$.",

Thermal oxidation can enhance the minority carrier lifetime in the 4H-SiC epilayer by reducing carbon vacancies. However, this process also generates carbon clusters with limited diffusivity and contributes to the enlargement of surface pits on the 4H-SiC. High-temperature hydrogen annealing effectively reduces stacking fault and dislocation density. Moreover, electron spin resonance analysis indicates a significant reduction in carbon vacancy defects after hydrogen annealing. The mechanisms of the elimination of carbon vacancies by hydrogen annealing include the decomposition of carbon clusters formed during thermal oxidation and the low-pressure selective etching by hydrogen, which increases the carbon content on the 4H-SiC surface and facilitates carbon diffusion. Consequently, the combination of thermal oxidation and hydrogen annealing eliminates carbon vacancies more effectively, substantially enhancing the minority carrier lifetime in P-type 4H-SiC. This improvement is advantageous for the application of high-voltage SiC bipolar devices.",

Conventional studies of charge transport in a-IGZO usually involve steady-state or transient measurements on field-effect transistors. Here, we employed microwave impedance microscopy to carry out position-dependent time-of-flight (TOF) experiments on a-IGZO devices, which offer spatial and temporal information of the underlying transport dynamics. The drift mobility calculated from the delay time between carrier injection and onset of TOF response is 2 - 3 cm2/Vs, consistent with the field-effect mobility from device measurements. The spatiotemporal conductivity data can be nicely fitted to a two-step function, corresponding to two coexisting mechanisms with a typical timescale of milliseconds. The competition between multiple-trap-and-release conduction through band-tail states and hopping conduction through deep trap states is evident from the fitting parameters. The underlying length scale and time scale of charge dynamics in a-IGZO are of fundamental importance for transparent and flexible nanoelectronics and optoelectronics, as well as emerging back-end-of-line applications.",

In this paper, we carry out an investigation into the $D^+$-meson leptonic decays $D^+\\to \\ell^+\u03bd_{\\ell}$ with $\\ell=(e,\u03bc,\u03c4)$ by employing the QCD sum rules approach. In which the $D^+$-meson decay constant $f_{D^+}$ is an important input parameter in the process. To enhance the accuracy of our calculations for $f_{D^+}$, we consider the quark propagator and vertex up to dimension-six within the framework of background field theory. Consequently, we obtain the QCD sum rule expression for $f_{D^+}$ up to dimension-six condensates, yielding $f_{D^+}=203.0\\pm1.5~\\mathrm{MeV}$. Our results are in good agreement with BESIII measurements and theoretical predictions. We also present the integrated decay widths for the $D^+$-meson in three channels $\u0393(D^+\\to e^+\u03bd_e)=(5.263_{-0.075}^{+0.076})\\times10^{-21}~\\mathrm{GeV}$, $\u0393(D^+\\to \u03bc^+\u03bd_\u03bc)=(2.236_{-0.032}^{+0.032})\\times10^{-16}~\\mathrm{GeV}$ and $\u0393(D^+\\to \u03c4^+\u03bd_\u03c4)=(5.958_{-0.085}^{+0.086})\\times10^{-16}~\\mathrm{GeV}$.

Here, we report on the characterization of the structural, chemical and electronic properties of few-layer FeSe on bilayer graphene grown on SiC(0001) using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). STM imaging of our FeSe films with thicknesses up to three layers exhibit the tetragonal crystal structure of bulk FeSe, which is supported by XPS spectra consistent with the FeSe bulk counterpart. While our STS measurements at 340 mK reveal a metallic character for few-layer FeSe on BLG/SiC(0001), they show an absence of superconductivity, as the low-lying electronic structure exhibits a spatially anisotropic dip-like feature robust against magnetic fields. Superconductivity in FeSe/BLG/SiC(0001), however, emerges for thicker films with a transition temperature of 6 K. Our results underscore the significance of the substrate as key factor driving the suppression superconductivity in FeSe in the 2D limit.",

Subsequently we introduce our discovery of the broader LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ (Ln:Ce-Nd,Sm,Gd-Tm,Lu,Y) family of kagome metals and an analogous DW transition in LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$. Our X-ray scattering measurements clearly indicate a (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) ordering wave vector ($\\sqrt{3}\\times\\sqrt{3}\\times3$ superlattice) and diffuse scattering on half-integer $L$-planes. Our analysis of the structural data supports the ``rattling mode'' DW model proposed for ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ and paints a detailed picture of the steric interactions between the rare-earth filler element and the host Nb-Sn kagome scaffolding. We also provide a broad survey of the magnetic properties within the HfFe$_6$Ge$_6$-type LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ members, revealing a number of complex antiferromagnetic and metamagnetic transitions throughout the family.

Silicon dimer wires are much more stable than wires composed of individual dangling bonds. Dimer wires composed of 1 to 5 dimers were intentionally fabricated and characterised by STM techniques combined with density functional theory to provide detailed insights into geometric and electronic structure. Structural and dynamic qualities displayed by short wires were shown to be similar to the characteristics of a relatively long 37 dimer wire. Rather than adding two states into the band gap, experiment and theory reveal that each dimer adds one empty state into the gap and one filled state into the valence bands.

Our model combines the low-energy limit of charge carriers in a buckled honeycomb lattice with the low-energy approximation for phonons and the electron-phonon interaction in a two-dimensional material. Hence, we obtain a massive Dirac-like field interacting with a two-component vector field $\\mathcal{A}_i$, describing the phonon field. This provides a one-loop electron self-energy at finite temperature and, from this, we calculate the renormalized band gap $m_R$. Thereafter, our effective model is applied for describing the renormalized optical band gap in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WS$_2$, and WSe$_2$, where a good agreement is found for reasonable values of our ultraviolet cutoff $\u039b\\approx 1$ eV. The main result establishes that, at low temperatures, $m_R$ is almost constant while for higher temperatures it is a decreasing linear function of the temperature $T$. We obtain that $m_R$ decreases about $\\approx [0.1,0.2]$ eV whenever we increase the temperature from $\\approx 4$ K to $500$ K, which is consistent with recent experimental measurements.

        "abstract": "Disordered alloys of silver and gold have been in the interest of the condensed matter community for decades since they are the prototype of the ideal solid solution due to the chemical similarity of their constituents and due to their potential industrial applications. Although they are considered well-known materials, surprises have appeared that have not been well understood despite several studies performed. One example are the experimental results of the electronic specific heat at low temperatures of disordered Ag-Au alloys. In 1966, Green and Valladares [Phys. Rev. 142, 379 (1966)] conducted experimental studies of $\u03b3$, the coefficient of the temperature in the expression for the electronic specific heat at low temperatures, finding a parabolic behavior as a function of the concentration, when a linear interpolation between the pure-element values was expected. This detonated several ulterior experiments that corroborated this parabolic behavior, and theoretical attempts followed that did not satisfactorily succeed at the explanation. It is our hope that this paper will contribute to the understanding of the experimental results; old problems can be reanalyzed with the help of new tools.",

        "abstract": "Antiferromagnets exhibit rapid spin dynamics in a net zero magnetic background which enables novel spintronic applications and interrogation of many-body quantum phenomena. The layered antiferromagnet Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ hosts an exotic spin one-half Mott insulating state with an electronic gap arising from on-site Coulomb repulsion and strong spin-orbit coupling. This makes Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ an interesting candidate to interrogate dynamical attributes of the magnetic order using ultrafast laser pulses. We investigate the magnetization dynamics of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ following circularly-polarized photoexcitation with below-gap mid-infrared (mid-IR -- 9 $\u03bcm$) and above-gap near-infrared (near-IR -- 1.3 $\u03bcm$) pulses. In both cases, we observe excitation of a zone-center coherent magnon mode featuring a 0.5 THz oscillation in the pump-induced Kerr-rotation signal. However, only below-gap excitation exhibits a helicity dependent response and linear (quadratic) scaling of the coherent magnon amplitude with excitation fluence (electric field). Moreover, below-gap excitation has a magnon generation efficiency that is at least two orders of magnitude greater in comparison to above-gap excitation. Our analysis indicates that the helicity dependence and enhanced generation efficiency arises from a unique one-photon two-magnon coupling mechanism for magnon generation. Thus, preferential spin-photon coupling without photoexcitation of electrons permits extremely efficient magnon generation. Our results reveal new possibilities for ultrafast control of antiferromagnets.",

In this work, we present an efficient approach based on algebraic diagrammatic construction theory with polarizable embedding that allows to accurately simulate ionized electronic states in condensed-phase or biochemical environments (PE-IP-ADC). We showcase the capabilities of PE-IP-ADC by computing the vertical ionization energy (VIE) of thymine molecule solvated in bulk water. Our results show that the second- and third-order PE-IP-ADC methods combined with the basis of set of triple-zeta quality yield a solvent-induced shift in VIE of -0.92 and -0.94 eV, respectively, in an excellent agreement with experimental estimate of -0.9 eV. This work demonstrates the power of PE-IP-ADC approach for simulating charged electronic states in realistic chemical environments and motivates its further development.",

A mirror field is found to enhance the impact of magnetization over an axial field; this is because the mirror field more closely follows the hot-spot surface. A cusp field, while simple to generate, is not found to have any benefits over the tried-and-tested axial field. Closed field lines are found to be of the greatest benefit to hot-spot performance, with the simulated design undergoing a 2x increase in ion temperature before alpha-heating is considered. The plasma properties of the simulation with closed field lines are radically different from the unmagnetized counterpart, with electron temperatures in excess of 100 keV, suggesting that a fundamental redesign of the capsule implosion is possible if this method is pursued.",

The assessment focused on documents that garnered 100 citations or more from the Web of Science Core Collection, spanning from their publication date to the end of 2022. Various aspects of these documents were analyzed, encompassing document types, the distribution of annual production, the average number of citations per publication, Web of Science categories, and journals. Moreover, the publication performance of countries, institutions, and authors underwent evaluation through six publication indicators and associated citation metrics. To facilitate a comprehensive comparison of the authors research performance, the Y-index was employed. The outcomes of the analysis revealed that a majority of the highly cited articles were published within the Web of Science categories of \"artificial intelligence computer science\" and \"electrical and electronic engineering\". Notably, the United States exhibited dominance across all six publication indicators. Within the realm of average citations per publication, the United Kingdom emerged as a leader for independent articles, first-author articles, and corresponding-author articles. Exceptionally, the Chinese Academy of Sciences in China and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the USA, contributed significantly. The significant impact of highly cited articles extended to the output of Stanford University in the USA. B.L. Bassler published the most highly cited articles. Upon employing the Y-index analysis, J.E.P. Santos was identified as having the highest potential for publication. In addition to the primary analysis, this study also presented nine classic articles that have left an indelible mark on artificial intelligence research.",

A body of theory has been developed over several decades that, in principle, allows rigorous proof of dynamical properties in high dimensions that is not normally feasible in nonlinear dynamical systems. Previous work has, however, used examples of dimension no higher than 6 to illustrate the methods. Here we show that the same tools can be applied in dimensions at least as high as 20. An important application of Glass networks is to a recently-proposed design of a True Random Number Generator that is based on an intrinsically chaotic electronic circuit. In order for analysis to be meaningful for the application, the dimension must be at least 20. Bifurcation diagrams show what appear to be periodic and chaotic bands. Here we demonstrate that the analytic tools for Glass networks can be used to rigorously show where periodic orbits are lost, and the types of bifurcations that occur there. The main tools are linear algebra and the stability theory of Poincar\u00e9 maps. All main steps can be automated, and we provide computer code. The methods reviewed here have the potential for many other applications involving sharply switching interactions, such as artificial neural networks.",

In the presence of competing interactions or quenched disorder, however, some systems can show unusual configurations that become more disordered at low temperature, a rare phenomenon known as \"inverse melting\". Here, we discover an inverse melting of the polar order in a ferroelectric oxide with quenched chemical disorder (BaTi1-xZrxO3) through direct atomic-scale visualization using in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy. In contrast to the clean BaTiO3 parent system in which long range order tracks lower temperatures, we observe in the doped system BaTi1-xZrxO3 that thermally driven fluctuations at high temperature give way to a more ordered state and then to a re-entrant disordered configuration at even lower temperature. Such an inverse melting of the polar order is likely linked to the random field generated by Zr dopants, which modulates the energy landscape arising from the competition between thermal fluctuations and random field pinning potential. These visualizations highlight a rich landscape of order and disorder in materials with quenched disorder, which may be key to understanding their advanced functionalities.",

Its inverse formulation, parameter estimation, aims to infer the inherent model parameters from observations. However, parameter degeneracy, where different combinations of parameters yield the same observable output, poses a critical barrier to accurately and uniquely identifying model parameters. In the context of WECC composite load model (CLM) in power systems, utility practitioners have observed that CLM parameters carefully selected for one fault event may not perform satisfactorily in another fault. Here, we innovate a joint conditional diffusion model-based inverse problem solver (JCDI), that incorporates a joint conditioning architecture with simultaneous inputs of multi-event observations to improve parameter generalizability. Simulation studies on the WECC CLM show that the proposed JCDI effectively reduces uncertainties of degenerate parameters, thus the parameter estimation error is decreased by 42.1% compared to a single-event learning scheme. This enables the model to achieve high accuracy in predicting power trajectories under different fault events, including electronic load tripping and motor stalling, outperforming standard deep reinforcement learning and supervised learning approaches. We anticipate this work will contribute to mitigating parameter degeneracy in system dynamics, providing a general parameter estimation framework across various scientific domains.",

We analyze the nature of atmospheric oxidation of both niobium and a-tantalum surfaces at time scales relevant to fabrication, from sub-minute to two-week atmospheric exposure, employing a combination of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy to monitor the growth of the surface oxides. The oxidation kinetics are modeled according to the Cabrera-Mott model of surface oxidation, and the model growth parameters are reported for both films. Our results indicate that niobium surface oxidation follows a consistent regime of inverse logarithmic growth for the entire time scale of the study, whereas a-Ta surface oxidation shows a clear transition between two inverse logarithmic growth regimes at time t = 1 hour, associated with the re-coordination of the surface oxide as determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. Our findings provide a more complete understanding of the differences in atmospheric surface oxidation between Nb and a-Ta, particularly at short time scales, paving the way for the development of more robust fabrication control for quantum computing architectures.",

This substitution enables tunable magnetic and electronic properties. Using various angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) techniques, including spin-resolved and circular dichroism (CD) measurements, we analyzed the evolution of the electronic structure across different Pb concentrations, with a focus on topological phase transitions (TPT) near x = 50 %. Key indicators of TPT include the presence or absence of topological surface states (TSS) and bulk band gap closure. The results show a gradual decrease of the bulk band gap in the electronic structure of MPBT up to x = 40 %, where it nearly vanishes, followed by a constant gap value between 40 - 60 %, and its reopening above 80 %, which is accompanied by a transition of the electronic structure of MPBT to a PbBi$_2$Te$_4$-like electronic structure. TSS were observed at x less than 30 % and greater than 80 %, as confirmed by CD and spin-resolved ARPES data, but were absent near x = 55 %, suggesting a distinct topological phase - possibly semi-metallic or a trivial insulator with a narrow gap phase. These findings demonstrate the tunability of the electronic structure of MPBT, making it a promising candidate for topological and spintronic applications.",

The time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation (TISE) is solved using the Finite Element Method (FEM) with a self-developed Julia package FEMTISE to compute potential energy curves (PECs) and the parameters of the interactions between particles. The time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation (TDSE) is solved using the Multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) algorithm. The time dependent electronic and nuclear probability densities are calculated for different electron incoming energies, evidencing elastic and inelastic processes that can be correlated to changes in von Neumann entropy, conditional mutual information and Shannon entropies. The expectation value of the position of the particles, as well as their standard deviations, are analyzed along the whole dynamics and related to the entanglement during the collision and after the process is over, hence evidencing the dynamics of entanglement generation. It is shown that the correlations generated in the collision is partially retained only when the inelastic process is active.",

Traditionally, EHRs have been used to support a wide range of administrative activities such as billing and clinical workflow, but, given the depth and breadth of clinical and demographic data they contain, they are increasingly being used to provide real-world data for research. Although EHR data have enormous research potential, the full realization of that potential requires a data management strategy that extracts from large EHR databases, that are collected from a range of care settings and time periods, well-documented research-relevant data that can be used by different researchers. Having a common well-documented data management strategy for EHR will support reproducible research and sharing documentation on research variables that are derived from EHR variables is important to open science. In this short paper, we describe the EHRs Data Harmonization Platform. The platform is based on an easy to use web app a publicly available at https://poxotn-arian-aminoleslami.shinyapps.io/Arian/ and as a standalone software package at https://github.com/ArianAminoleslami/EHRs-Data Harmonization-Platform, that is linked to an existing R library for data harmonization called recodeflow.

        "abstract": "We consider an assortment optimization problem under the multinomial logit choice model with general covering constraints. In this problem, the seller offers an assortment that should contain a minimum number of products from multiple categories. We refer to these constraints as covering constraints. Such constraints are common in practice due to service level agreements with suppliers or diversity considerations within the assortment. We consider both the deterministic version, where the seller decides on a single assortment, and the randomized version, where they choose a distribution over assortments. In the deterministic case, we provide a $1/(\\log K+2)$-approximation algorithm, where $K$ is the number of product categories, matching the problem's hardness up to a constant factor. For the randomized setting, we show that the problem is solvable in polynomial time via an equivalent linear program. We also extend our analysis to multi-segment assortment optimization with covering constraints, where there are $m$ customer segments, and an assortment is offered to each. In the randomized setting, the problem remains polynomially solvable. In the deterministic setting, we design a $(1 - \u03b5) / (\\log K + 2)$-approximation algorithm for constant $m$ and a $1 / (m (\\log K + 2))$-approximation for general $m$, which matches the hardness up to a logarithmic factor. Finally, we conduct a numerical experiment using real data from an online electronics store, categorizing products by price range and brand. Our findings demonstrate that, in practice, it is feasible to enforce a minimum number of representatives from each category while incurring a relatively small revenue loss. Moreover, we observe that the optimal expected revenue in both deterministic and randomized settings is often comparable, and the optimal solution in the randomized setting typically involves only a few assortments.",

In this paper, we consider a specific type of cyberattack known as the injection attack. As demonstrated by empirical data from real-world cybersecurity adversarial competitions(available at https://mimic2024.xctf.org.cn/race/qwmimic2024 ), these injection attacks have excitation effect over time, gradually manipulating network traffic and disrupting the vehicle's normal functioning, ultimately compromising both its stability and safety. To profile the abnormal behavior of attackers, we propose a novel injection attack detector to extract long-term features of attack behavior. Specifically, we first provide a theoretical analysis of modeling the time-excitation effects of the attack using Multi-Dimensional Hawkes Process (MDHP). A gradient descent solver specifically tailored for MDHP, MDHP-GDS, is developed to accurately estimate optimal MDHP parameters. We then propose an injection attack detector, MDHP-Net, which integrates optimal MDHP parameters with MDHP-LSTM blocks to enhance temporal feature extraction. By introducing MDHP parameters, MDHP-Net captures complex temporal features that standard Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cannot, enriching temporal dependencies within our customized structure. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed detection approach.",

Specifically, the proposed models require only mean-field-like computational cost, while excited-state properties may approach the CCSD level of accuracy.

The second type is a modular jet composed of multiple 11-cm-long modules. Longitudinal density profile control is demonstrated with a 2-module (22 cm long) hydrogen jet using gas valve trigger timing. A 1.0-m-long jet is then assembled from 9 modules, and generation of 1.0-m long hydrogen plasma is demonstrated using a femtosecond Bessel beam.

While this field has been thoroughly investigated, a clear study on trajectory effects is lacking, particularly in the context of inelastic processes at low energies. In this work, we address this gap by solving the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the electron in a numerical lattice with a coupled electron-nuclear dynamics approach as well as a straight-line trajectory approximation for the nuclei to asses trajectory effects on charge exchange and energy loss. The collision dynamics are studied using bare ion projectiles with charge $Z=$1-4 incident on atomic hydrogen in an energy range of 0.1 to 900 keV/u. We find that the charge exchange process is trajectory-independent within the energy range considered, showing excellent agreement with available experimental and theoretical data. However, projectile energy loss exhibits strong trajectory dependence, with the straight-line approximation overestimating energy loss at low collision energies due to the forced linear path. Our results for electronic stopping cross sections with electron-nuclear coupled trajectories are consistent with the available experimental data at high collision energies. At low energies, nuclear energy loss becomes prominent, driven by polarization effects induced by the ion charge on the hydrogen target. Overall, our work highlights the importance of nuclear trajectory considerations in collision dynamics and offers a foundation for further investigations of more complex systems.",

However, a signal in future experiments such as the light dark matter experiment (LDMX) would require an independent validation to assert its DM origin. To this end, we propose to combine LDMX and next generation DM direct detection (DD) data in a four-step analysis strategy, which we here illustrate with Monte Carlo simulations. In the first step, the hypothetical LDMX signal (i.e. an excess in the final state electron energy and transverse momentum distributions) is $\\textit{recorded}$. In the second step, a DM DD experiment operates with increasing exposure to test the DM origin of the LDMX signal. Here, LDMX and DD data are simulated. In the third step, a posterior probability density function (pdf) for the DM model parameters is extracted from the DD data, and used to $\\textit{predict}$ the electron recoil energy and transverse momentum distributions at LDMX. In the last step, $\\textit{predicted}$ and $\\textit{recorded}$ electron recoil energy and transverse momentum distributions are compared in a chi-square test. We present the results of this comparison in terms of a threshold exposure that a DD experiment has to operate with to assert whether $\\textit{predicted}$ and $\\textit{recorded}$ distributions $\\textit{can}$ be statistically dependent. We find that this threshold exposure grows with the DM particle mass, $m_\u03c7$. It varies from 0.012 kg-year for a DM mass of $m_\u03c7=4$ MeV to 1 kg-year for $m_\u03c7=25$ MeV, which is or will soon be within reach.",

Theoretically, the particle acceleration mechanisms responsible for blazar emissions and the precise location within the jet where this occurs remain undetermined. This paper explores MM emission driven by magnetic reconnection in a blazar jet. Previous studies have shown that reconnection in the magnetically dominated regions of these relativistic jets can efficiently accelerate particles to very high energies (VHE). Assuming that turbulent-driven magnetic reconnection accelerates cosmic-ray protons and electrons by a Fermi process, we developed a lepto-hadronic radiation model without the influence of external soft-photons to explain the 2017 MM flare from TXS 0506+056. In the proposed scenario, the emission blob moves downstream in the jet from $\\sim$2 to 4 pc from the central engine, which is a supermassive black hole (SMBH) of $3 \\times 10^{8}$ M$_\\odot$ launching a jet with $150L_\\mathrm{Edd}$ power. As the blob moves, we observe a sequence of spectral energy distribution (SED) profiles that match the observed arrival of the high energy neutrino and electromagnetic emission from TXS 0506+056. This arrival coincides with the high state of intermediate energy $\u03b3$-rays ($E \\sim 1 $ GeV) detection, followed by the subsequent appearance of the VHE $\u03b3$-ray signal and then no further significant neutrino detection. We obtain a time delay between the neutrino and VHE events $\\simeq 6.4$ days, which is consistent with that observed in the 2017 MM flare.",

The data sample was recorded in 2015 and 2018, amounting to an integrated luminosity of 1.9 nb$^{-1}$. Events with exactly one electron and one muon and at least two jets are selected. Top-quark pair production is measured with an observed (expected) significance of 5.0 (4.1) standard deviations.

        "abstract": "Near-beta titanium alloys have shown low Young's modulus and good strength, making them excellent implant candidates. However, their processing using thermomechanical routes in single phase beta region results in heterogeneous microstructures due to high content alloying elements and consequent slow diffusion-controlled processes such as dynamic recovery. This study investigates the deformation behaviour of a Ti-15Mo alloy through hot compression experiments using a Gleeble 3800 device in the single beta domain at strain rates from 0.01 s-1 to 10 s-1, reaching final strains of 0.50 and 0.85 followed by immediate water quench. The findings show that the material presents a low strain rate sensitivity. The flow curves show significant strain hardening before reaching a steady-state regime, particularly at high strain rates. The strain hardening exponent calculations support the effect of molybdenum on retarding softening mechanisms such as dynamic recovery. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) measurements of deformed samples revealed that dynamic recovery is the primary restoration mechanism, with continuous and geometric dynamic recrystallisation evidence. Due to the slow restoration process, we observe the subgrain formation for different deformation parameters. Therefore, we introduced an EBSD-based method to quantify dynamic recovery and subgrain size. We concluded that dynamic recovery and dynamic recrystallisation decrease as the strain rate increases with minimal variation at higher strain rates.",

Despite simple magnetic structures, these altermagnets exhibit intriguing and intricate dependence of AHE on the N\u00e9el vector, in contrast to the conventional perpendicular configuration of Hall current with magnetization in ferromagnets. However, the relationship between the AHE and the N\u00e9el vector remains largely elusive. Here, we propose an \"extrinsic parameter\" method and further reveal diverse unconventional anomalous Hall textures in the N\u00e9el vector space, dubbed anomalous-Hall N\u00e9el textures (AHNTs), for altermagnets. Notably, we find that AHNTs resemble the spin textures in momentum space, and identify 10 types across four categories of AHNTs in altermagnets. Meanwhile, we examine our key discoveries in prototypical altermagnets. Our work can offer a methodology for detecting N\u00e9el vectors via anomalous Hall transport, and provide useful guidelines for designing electronic and optoelectronic devices based on altermagnets.",

Dipolar interactions between these electronic states are then translated into effective interactions among ground state atoms. Motivated by recent experiments, we investigate two dressing protocols, in which Rydberg atoms are resonantly excited in a stroboscopic fashion. The first one is non-adiabatic, meaning Rydberg states are excited by fast pulses. In this case, mechanical forces among Rydberg atoms result in electron-motion coupling, which generates effective multi-body interactions. In the second, adiabatic protocol, Rydberg states are excited by smoothly varying laser pulses. We show that also in this protocol substantial multi-body interactions emerge.",

Accurate control over laser-induced processes in semiconductors is essential for generating surface structures and modifying surface properties. In this study, we present a numerical investigation of non-equilibrium laser-induced phase transitions in silicon (Si) using a hybrid atomistic-continuum model. The model combines the strengths of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations for atomisticscale descriptions of non-equilibrium phase transitions with a continuum approach to account for laser-generated free carriers. This framework captures the generation and diffusion of electronhole pairs, thermal diffusion, and electron-phonon coupling during laser energy deposition. We apply the model to determine the melting depth as a function of fluence for a 100 fs laser pulse at 800 nm. The results show that the stand-alone continuum approach underestimates the melting threshold compared to the hybrid atomistic-continuum model, which incorporates the detailed kinetics of melting. Additionally, we explore the effect of crystal orientation on melting dynamics. Lastly, the MD model is used to identify the conditions leading to the amorphization of the Si surface. These findings provide valuable insights into experimental observations of Si surface structuring induced by ultrashort laser pulses.",

The performance of seeded FELs is critically dependent on the quality of the frequency up-conversion process. Optimized conditions for seeded FELs are typically considered as the maximization of the bunching factor. This paper discusses alternative perspectives on the optimization criteria for seeded FELs by analyzing the impact of dispersion strength on their overall performance. We investigate the relationship among the required dispersion strength for achieving the maximum bunching factor, maximum pulse energy, and optimal energy stability through theoretical analysis, simulation calculations, and experimental explorations. Additionally, the direct observation of pulse splitting emphasizes the consideration of trade-off between pulse energy and temporal coherence in seeded FELs. These results provide valuable insights and practical guidance for controlling the pulse characteristics of seeded FELs, contributing to the tuning and optimization of FEL facilities.",

Unlike existing neural implicit representation methods, UniHands uses the widely-adopted parametric models MANO and NIMBLE, providing a more scalable and versatile solution. It also derives unified hand joints from the meshes, which facilitates seamless integration into various hand-related tasks. Experiments on the FreiHAND and InterHand2.6M datasets demonstrate its ability to precisely reconstruct hand mesh vertices and keypoints, effectively capturing high-degree articulation motions.

A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state.In contrast, humans can $\\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and $\\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined observations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\\textit{Generative World Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To train $\\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\\textit{Genex}$ can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.",

Extensive experimental results on language modeling demonstrate that Bi-Mamba achieves performance comparable to its full-precision counterparts (e.g., FP16 or BF16) and much better accuracy than post-training-binarization (PTB) Mamba baselines, while significantly reducing memory footprint and energy consumption compared to the original Mamba model.

On the one hand, this algorithm allows circumventing the feature problem, thus fully exploiting the capabilities of the PMC. On the other hand, it enables the PMC to extend any predictive model by introducing hidden states, updated at each time step, and allowing the introduction of non-stationarity for any model. We apply the PMC with its new algorithm for volatility forecasting, which we compare to the highly popular GARCH(1,1) and feedforward neural models across numerous pairs. This is particularly relevant given the regime changes that we can observe in volatility.

Existing sampling-based approaches inherently disconnect the parameters by generating samples for each independently and combining them through composition and rejection, while optimization-based methods struggle with highly non-convex constraints and local optima. Our method treats TAMP constraint satisfaction as optimizing a batch of particles, each representing an assignment to a plan skeleton's continuous parameters. We represent the plan skeleton's constraints using differentiable cost functions, enabling us to compute the gradient of each particle and update it toward satisfying solutions. Our use of GPU parallelism better covers the parameter space through scale, increasing the likelihood of finding the global optima by exploring multiple basins through global sampling. We demonstrate that our algorithm can effectively solve a highly constrained Tetris packing problem using a Franka arm in simulation and deploy our planner on a real robot arm.

        "abstract": "Accurate and fast recognition of forgeries is an issue of great importance in the fields of artificial intelligence, image processing and object detection. Recognition of forgeries of facial imagery is the process of classifying and defining the faces in it by analyzing real-world facial images. This process is usually accomplished by extracting features from an image, using classifier algorithms, and correctly interpreting the results. Recognizing forgeries of facial imagery correctly can encounter many different challenges. For example, factors such as changing lighting conditions, viewing faces from different angles can affect recognition performance, and background complexity and perspective changes in facial images can make accurate recognition difficult. Despite these difficulties, significant progress has been made in the field of forgery detection. Deep learning algorithms, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have significantly improved forgery detection performance.\n  This study focuses on image processing-based forgery detection using Fake-Vs-Real-Faces (Hard) [10] and 140k Real and Fake Faces [61] data sets. Both data sets consist of two classes containing real and fake facial images. In our study, two lightweight deep learning models are proposed to conduct forgery detection using these images. Additionally, 8 different pretrained CNN architectures were tested on both data sets and the results were compared with newly developed lightweight CNN models. It's shown that the proposed lightweight deep learning models have minimum number of layers. It's also shown that the proposed lightweight deep learning models detect forgeries of facial imagery accurately, and computationally efficiently. Although the data set consists only of face images, the developed models can also be used in other two-class object recognition problems.",

However, both QM/MM and QM/cDFT rely on approximations that introduce ambiguities. This series of papers aims to establish a rigorous theoretical framework to guide the development of a QM/cDFT formulation that clarifies the approximations involved. In this first paper, we establish a comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) framework for mixed quantum (QM)-classical (MM) systems within the canonical ensemble. We derive the equilibrium density matrix for a system comprising N qm QM and N mm MM particles and, based on this derivation, propose a variational formulation of the Helmholtz free energy in terms of the full QM-MM density matrix. By leveraging permutational symmetry and thanks to constrained-search methods, we reformulate the variational problem using functionals of objects having reduced dimensionalities. Three different formulations are presented, each using quantities with progressively lower dimensionalities. This ultimately enables computation of the Helmholtz free energy using only the QM and MM one-body densities, generalizing both cDFT and electronic DFT (eDFT) for QM-MM systems. In a subsequent paper, this formalism will be extended to the grand canonical ensemble, allowing classical particle number fluctuations. This extension, in which cDFT is most naturally formulated, provides a framework for studying solvation problems.",

When the initial state of the polymer is not collapsed or the final folded native state, the dynamics of dimerization can follow a course sensitive to both the initial conditions and the conformational dynamics. Here we study the dimerization process by using computer simulations and analytical theory where both the two monomeric polymer chains are in the elongated state and are initially placed at a separation distance, d0. Subsequent dynamics lead to the concurrent processes of collapse, dimerization and/or escape. We employ Langevin dynamics simulations with a coarse-grained model of the polymer to capture certain aspects of the dimerization process. At separations d0 much shorter than the length of the monomeric polymer, the dimerization could happen fast and irreversibly, from the partly extended polymer state itself. At an initial separation larger than a critical distance, dc, the polymer collapse precedes dimerization and a significant number of single polymers do not dimerize within the time scale of simulations. To quantify these competition, we introduce several time-dependent order parameters, namely, (i) the time-dependent radius of gyration of individual polymers describing the conformational state of the polymer, (ii) a centre-to-centre of mass distance parameter RMM, and (iii) a time dependent overlap function Q(t) between the two monomeric polymers, mimicking contact order parameter popular in protein folding. In order to better quantify the findings, we perform a theoretical analysis to capture the stochastic processes of collapse and dimerization by using dynamical disorder model.",

The focus is on probabilistic reach-avoid specifications. The framework is based on abstracting a stochastic system into a new class of robust Markov models, called orthogonally decoupled Interval Markov Decision Processes (odIMDPs). Specifically, an odIMDPs is a class of robust Markov processes, where the transition probabilities between each pair of states are uncertain and have the product form. We show that such a specific form in the transition probabilities allows one to build compositional abstractions of stochastic systems that, for each state, are only required to store the marginal probability bounds of the original system. This leads to improved memory complexity for our approach compared to commonly employed abstraction-based approaches. Furthermore, we show that an optimal control strategy for a odIMDPs can be computed by solving a set of linear problems. When the resulting strategy is mapped back to the original system, it is guaranteed to lead to reduced conservatism compared to existing approaches. To test our theoretical framework, we perform an extensive empirical comparison of our methods against Interval Markov Decision Process- and Markov Decision Process-based approaches on various benchmarks including 7D systems. Our empirical analysis shows that our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both memory requirements and the conservatism of the results.",

The black-box nature of deep learning methods poses difficulties in interpreting the identified model. There is a dire need to interpret the machine learning models to develop a physical understanding of dynamic systems. An interpretable form of neural network called Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) or Multiplicative KAN (MultKAN) offers critical features that help recognize the nonlinearities in the governing ordinary/partial differential equations (ODE/PDE) of various dynamic systems and find their equation structures. In this study, an equation discovery framework is proposed that includes i) sequentially regularized derivatives for denoising (SRDD) algorithm to denoise the measure data to obtain accurate derivatives, ii) KAN to identify the equation structure and suggest relevant nonlinear functions that are used to create a small overcomplete library of functions, and iii) physics-informed spline fitting (PISF) algorithm to filter the excess functions from the library and converge to the correct equation. The framework was tested on the forced Duffing oscillator, Van der Pol oscillator (stiff ODE), Burger's equation, and Bouc-Wen model (coupled ODE). The proposed method converged to the true equation for the first three systems. It provided an approximate model for the Bouc-Wen model that could acceptably capture the hysteresis response. Using KAN maintains low complexity, which helps the user interpret the results throughout the process and avoid the black-box-type nature of machine learning methods.",

While deep learning methods, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, have significantly advanced fusion performance, some of the existing CNN-based methods fall short in capturing fine-grained multiscale and edge features, leading to suboptimal feature integration. Transformer-based models, on the other hand, are computationally intensive in both the training and fusion stages, making them impractical for real-time clinical use. Moreover, the clinical application of fused images remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN-based architecture that addresses these limitations by introducing a Dilated Residual Attention Network Module for effective multiscale feature extraction, coupled with a gradient operator to enhance edge detail learning. To ensure fast and efficient fusion, we present a parameter-free fusion strategy based on the weighted nuclear norm of softmax, which requires no additional computations during training or inference. Extensive experiments, including a downstream brain tumor classification task, demonstrate that our approach outperforms various baseline methods in terms of visual quality, texture preservation, and fusion speed, making it a possible practical solution for real-world clinical applications.

Then, we highlight in detail some major challenges and present the possible solutions: i) estimating the uncertainty of AI-based channel predictions, ii) integrating prior knowledge of propagation to improve generalization capabilities, and iii) interpretable AI for channel modeling. We present and discuss illustrative numerical results to showcase the capabilities of AI-based channel modeling.",

Traditional computational models often isolate individual biophysical processes, such as cardiac electromechanics and blood flow dynamics, failing to capture the system's integrated nature. This paper presents an innovative approach that couples a 3D electromechanical model of the heart with a 3D fluid mechanics model of vascular blood flow. Our file-based partitioned coupling scheme allows these models to run independently while sharing essential data through intermediate files. We validate this approach using two solvers: one for cardiac electromechanics and the other for vascular blood flow. Developed by separate research groups, these solvers emphasise different dynamical scales and utilise distinct discretisation schemes. Numerical simulations using idealised and realistic anatomies show that the implemented coupling scheme is reliable and requires minimal additional computation time relative to advancing individual time steps in the heart and blood flow models. Notably, the coupled model predicts muscle displacement differently than the standalone heart model, highlighting the influence of detailed vascular blood flow on cardiac function. This study presents a paradigm case of how to build virtual human models and digital twins by productive collaboration between teams with complementary expertise.",

The voting kiosk and protocol transmit votes over the internet and then transmit voter-verifiable paper ballots through the mail. In the MERGE protocol, the votes transmitted over the internet are used to tabulate the results and determine the winners, but audits and recounts use the paper ballots that arrive in time. The enunciated motivation for the protocol is to allow (electronic) votes from overseas military voters to be included in preliminary results before a (paper) ballot is received from the voter. MERGE contains interesting ideas that are not inherently unsound; but to make the system trustworthy--to apply the MERGE protocol--would require major changes to the laws, practices, and technical and logistical abilities of U.S. election jurisdictions. The gap between theory and practice is large and unbridgeable for the foreseeable future. Promoters of this research project at DARPA, the agency that sponsored the research, should acknowledge that MERGE is internet voting (election results rely on votes transmitted over the internet except in the event of a full hand count) and refrain from claiming that it could be a component of trustworthy elections without sweeping changes to election law and election administration throughout the U.S.",

With the release of JPEG AI - the first standard for end-to-end neural image compression (NIC) methods - the question of its robustness has become critically significant. JPEG AI is among the first international, real-world applications of neural-network-based models to be embedded in consumer devices. However, research on NIC robustness has been limited to open-source codecs and a narrow range of attacks. This paper proposes a new methodology for measuring NIC robustness to adversarial attacks. We present the first large-scale evaluation of JPEG AI's robustness, comparing it with other NIC models.

We study decentralized learning in two-sided matching markets where the demand side (aka players or agents) competes for a `large' supply side (aka arms) with potentially time-varying preferences, to obtain a stable match. Despite a long line of work in the recent past, existing learning algorithms such as Explore-Then-Commit or Upper-Confidence-Bound remain inefficient for this problem. In particular, the per-agent regret achieved by these algorithms scales linearly with the number of arms, $K$. Motivated by the linear contextual bandit framework, we assume that for each agent an arm-mean can be represented by a linear function of a known feature vector and an unknown (agent-specific) parameter.\n  Moreover, our setup captures the essence of a dynamic (non-stationary) matching market where the preferences over arms change over time. Our proposed algorithms achieve instance-dependent logarithmic regret, scaling independently of the number of arms, $K$.",

Traditionally, in FL settings, a central server assigns training efforts (or strategies) to clients. However, from a market-oriented perspective, clients may independently choose their training efforts based on rational self-interest. To explore this, we propose a potential game framework where each client's payoff is determined by their individual efforts and the rewards provided by the server. The rewards are influenced by the collective efforts of all clients and can be modulated through a reward factor. Our study begins by establishing the existence of Nash equilibria (NEs), followed by an investigation of uniqueness in homogeneous settings. We demonstrate a significant improvement in clients' training efforts at a critical reward factor, identifying it as the optimal choice for the server. Furthermore, we prove the convergence of the best-response algorithm to compute NEs for our FL game. Finally, we apply the training efforts derived from specific NEs to a real-world FL scenario, validating the effectiveness of the identified optimal reward factor.",

Operators must ensure maximum load delivery, reduced losses, and the operation between voltage limits. However, computations to decide the optimal feeder configuration are often computationally expensive and intractable, making it unfavorable for real-time operations. This is mainly due to the existence of binary variables in the network reconfiguration optimization problem. To tackle this issue, we have devised an approach that leverages machine learning techniques to reshape distribution networks featuring multiple substations. This involves predicting the substation responsible for serving each part of the network. Hence, it leaves simple and more tractable Optimal Power Flow problems to be solved. This method can produce accurate results in a significantly faster time, as demonstrated using the IEEE 37-bus distribution feeder. Compared to the traditional optimization-based approaches, a feasible solution is achieved approximately ten times faster for all the tested scenarios.",

This paper introduces Resoonance: a new kind of transaction fee mechanism that operates in a general two-sided marketplace setting with extreme preference heterogeneity on both sides of the market. We allow users submitting transactions to have arbitrary valuations for inclusion, nodes responsible for executing transactions to incur arbitrary net costs for executing any bundle, and further allow for arbitrary constraints in allocation validity. These constraints, for example, may range from representing an individual node's specialized hardware constraints to denoting the fact that transactions may not be executed in parallel across different nodes if they utilize the same part of the network's state. Transactions may even require multiple nodes for execution.\n  Resonance's design utilizes competition among sophisticated brokers to find idiosyncratic prices. We show that at pure Nash equilibria, Resonance finds an efficient outcome and minimizes the need for strategization by users and nodes. It is also budget-balanced, individually rational for all parties, and computationally tractable.",

However, the GAN training is well-known for its notorious training instability, usually characterized by the occurrence of mode collapse. Through the lens of gradients' variance, this work particularly analyzes the training instability and inefficiency in the presence of mode collapse by linking it to multimodality in the target distribution. To ease the raised training issues from severe multimodality, we introduce a novel GAN training framework that leverages a series of tempered distributions produced via convex interpolation. With our newly developed GAN objective function, the generator can learn all the tempered distributions simultaneously, conceptually resonating with the parallel tempering in Statistics. Our simulation studies demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing popular training strategies in both image and tabular data synthesis. We theoretically analyze that such significant improvement can arise from reducing the variance of gradient estimates by using the tempered distributions. Finally, we further develop a variant of the proposed framework aimed at generating fair synthetic data which is one of the growing interests in the field of trustworthy AI.",

They can be heterogeneous, with different zones for storage, entangling operations, and readout. Zoned architectures improve computation fidelity by shielding idling qubits in storage from side-effect noise, unlike monolithic architectures where all operations occur in a single zone. However, supporting these flexible architectures with efficient compilation remains challenging. In this paper, we propose ZAC, a scalable compiler for zoned architectures. ZAC minimizes data movement overhead between zones with qubit reuse, i.e., keeping them in the entanglement zone if an immediate entangling operation is pending. Other innovations include novel data placement and instruction scheduling strategies in ZAC, a flexible specification of zoned architectures, and an intermediate representation for zoned architectures, ZAIR. Our evaluation shows that zoned architectures equipped with ZAC achieve a 22x improvement in fidelity compared to monolithic architectures. Moreover, ZAC is shown to have a 10% fidelity gap on average compared to the ideal solution. This significant performance enhancement enables more efficient and reliable quantum circuit execution, enabling advancements in quantum algorithms and applications.

Discovery of new catalysts is currently limited by the gap between what AI-accelerated computational models predict and what experimental studies produce. To make progress, large and diverse experimental datasets are needed that are reproducible and tested at industrially-relevant conditions. We address these needs by utilizing a comprehensive high-throughput characterization and experimental pipeline to create the Open Catalyst Experiments 2024 (OCX24) dataset. The dataset contains 572 samples synthesized using both wet and dry methods with X-ray fluorescence and X-ray diffraction characterization. We prepared 441 gas diffusion electrodes, including replicates, and evaluated them using zero-gap electrolysis for carbon dioxide reduction (CO$_2$RR) and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) at current densities up to $300$ mA/cm$^2$. To find correlations with experimental outcomes and to perform computational screens, DFT-verified adsorption energies for six adsorbates were calculated on $\\sim$20,000 inorganic materials requiring 685 million AI-accelerated relaxations. Remarkably from this large set of materials, a data driven Sabatier volcano independently identified Pt as being a top candidate for HER without having any experimental measurements on Pt or Pt-alloy samples. We anticipate the availability of experimental data generated specifically for AI training, such as OCX24, will significantly improve the utility of computational models in selecting materials for experimental screening.",

        "abstract": "There is a growing need to understand how digital systems can support clinical decision-making, particularly as artificial intelligence (AI) models become increasingly complex and less human-interpretable. This complexity raises concerns about trustworthiness, impacting safe and effective adoption of such technologies. Improved understanding of decision-making processes and requirements for explanations coming from decision support tools is a vital component in providing effective explainable solutions. This is particularly relevant in the data-intensive, fast-paced environments of intensive care units (ICUs). To explore these issues, group interviews were conducted with seven ICU clinicians, representing various roles and experience levels. Thematic analysis revealed three core themes: (T1) ICU decision-making relies on a wide range of factors, (T2) the complexity of patient state is challenging for shared decision-making, and (T3) requirements and capabilities of AI decision support systems. We include design recommendations from clinical input, providing insights to inform future AI systems for intensive care.",

Chiral $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ spin models are known to exhibit a Devil's Flower phase structure, with inhomogeneous phases which can be thought of as $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ analogues of chiral spirals. Out of the large class of models we study, we find that only chiral spin models and their duals have a Devil's Flower structure with an infinite set of inhomogeneous phases, a result we attribute to Elitzur's theorem.

Our experiments reveal a surprising trend: the best existing rerankers provide diminishing returns when scoring progressively more documents and actually degrade quality beyond a certain limit. In fact, in this setting, rerankers can frequently assign high scores to documents with no lexical or semantic overlap with the query. We hope that our findings will spur future research to improve reranking.",

It uses Gramian Angular Field (GAF) transformations and federated deep learning to capture temporal and spatial gait patterns missed by traditional methods. We evaluated our FOGSense system using a public PD dataset, 'tdcsfog'. FOGSense improves accuracy by 10.4% over a single-axis accelerometer, reduces failure points compared to multi-sensor systems, and demonstrates robustness to missing values. The federated architecture allows personalized model adaptation and efficient smartphone synchronization during off-peak hours, making it effective for long-term monitoring as symptoms evolve. Overall, FOGSense achieves a 22.2% improvement in F1-score compared to state-of-the-art methods, along with enhanced sensitivity for FOG episode detection.

While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results in simulated environments, discrepancies between simulations and real-world conditions have limited its practical deployment. This study introduces an innovative control framework that integrates trajectory optimization with drift maneuvers, aiming to improve the algorithm's adaptability for real-vehicle implementation. We leveraged Bezier-based pre-trajectory optimization to enhance rewards and optimize the controller through Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) in a simulated environment. For real-world deployment, we implement a hybrid RL-MPC fusion mechanism, , where TD3-derived maneuvers serve as primary inputs for a Model Predictive Controller (MPC). This integration enables precise real-time tracking of the optimal trajectory, with MPC providing corrective inputs to bridge the gap between simulation and reality. The efficacy of this method is validated through real-vehicle tests on consumer-grade electric vehicles, focusing on drift U-turns and drift right-angle turns. The control outcomes of these real-vehicle tests are thoroughly documented in the paper, supported by supplementary video evidence (https://youtu.be/5wp67FcpfL8). Notably, this study is the first to deploy and apply an RL-based transient drift cornering algorithm on consumer-grade electric vehicles.",

Similar to how humans interact in social contexts, we can use many types of feedback to communicate our preferences, intentions, and knowledge to an RL agent. However, applications of human feedback in RL are often limited in scope and disregard human factors. In this work, we bridge the gap between machine learning and human-computer interaction efforts by developing a shared understanding of human feedback in interactive learning scenarios. We first introduce a taxonomy of feedback types for reward-based learning from human feedback based on nine key dimensions. Our taxonomy allows for unifying human-centered, interface-centered, and model-centered aspects. In addition, we identify seven quality metrics of human feedback influencing both the human ability to express feedback and the agent's ability to learn from the feedback. Based on the feedback taxonomy and quality criteria, we derive requirements and design choices for systems learning from human feedback. We relate these requirements and design choices to existing work in interactive machine learning. In the process, we identify gaps in existing work and future research opportunities. We call for interdisciplinary collaboration to harness the full potential of reinforcement learning with data-driven co-adaptive modeling and varied interaction mechanics.",

These results constitute a turning point, not only for dark matter searches that are now entering the \\textit{neutrino fog}, but they also bring out new opportunities to exploit dark matter facilities as neutrino detectors. We investigate the implications of recent data from the PandaX-4T and XENONnT experiments on both Standard Model physics and new neutrino interactions. We first extract information on the weak mixing angle at low momentum transfer. Then, following a phenomenological approach, we consider Lorentz-invariant interactions (scalar, vector, axial-vector, and tensor) between neutrinos, quarks and charged leptons. Furthermore, we study the $U(1)_\\mathrm{B-L}$ scenario as a concrete example of a new anomaly-free vector interaction. We find that despite the low statistics of these first experimental results, the inferred bounds are in some cases already competitive. For the scope of this work we also compute new bounds on some of the interactions using CE$\u03bd$NS data from COHERENT and electron recoil data from XENONnT, LUX-ZEPLIN, PandaX-4T, and TEXONO. It seems clear that while direct detection experiments continue to take data, more precise measurements will be available, thus allowing to test new neutrino interactions at the same level or even improving over dedicated neutrino facilities.",

For example, nonparametric regression methods allow for the estimation of regression functions in a data-driven manner with minimal assumptions; however, these methods typically fail to achieve $\\sqrt{n}$-consistency in their convergence rates, and many, including those in machine learning, lack guarantees that their estimators asymptotically follow a normal distribution. To address these challenges, we propose a debiasing technique for nonparametric estimators by adding a bias-correction term to the original estimators, extending the conventional one-step estimator used in semiparametric analysis. Specifically, for each data point, we estimate the conditional expected residual of the original nonparametric estimator, which can, for instance, be computed using kernel (Nadaraya-Watson) regression, and incorporate it as a bias-reduction term. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed estimator achieves $\\sqrt{n}$-consistency and asymptotic normality under a mild convergence rate condition for both the original nonparametric estimator and the conditional expected residual estimator. Notably, this approach remains model-free as long as the original estimator and the conditional expected residual estimator satisfy the convergence rate condition. The proposed method offers several advantages, including improved estimation accuracy and simplified construction of confidence intervals.",

The primary goal of these approaches is to address the challenge of optimization methods becoming trapped in suboptimal local minima by replacing the standard gradient with a non-local gradient derived from averaging function values using anisotropic Gaussian smoothing. Unlike isotropic Gaussian smoothing (IGS), AGS adapts the smoothing directionality based on the properties of the underlying function, aligning better with complex loss landscapes and improving convergence. The anisotropy is computed by adjusting the covariance matrix of the Gaussian distribution, allowing for directional smoothing tailored to the gradient's behavior. This technique mitigates the impact of minor fluctuations, enabling the algorithms to approach global minima more effectively. We provide detailed convergence analyses that extend the results from both the original (unsmoothed) methods and the IGS case to the more general anisotropic smoothing, applicable to both convex and non-convex, L-smooth functions. In the stochastic setting, these algorithms converge to a noisy ball, with its size determined by the smoothing parameters. The article also outlines the theoretical benefits of anisotropic smoothing and details its practical implementation using Monte Carlo estimation, aligning with established zero-order optimization techniques.",

Yet the substantial memory footprint of LLMs significantly hinders their deployment. In this paper, we improve the accessibility of LLMs through BitMoD, an algorithm-hardware co-design solution that enables efficient LLM acceleration at low weight precision. On the algorithm side, BitMoD introduces fine-grained data type adaptation that uses a different numerical data type to quantize a group of (e.g., 128) weights. Through the careful design of these new data types, BitMoD is able to quantize LLM weights to very low precision (e.g., 4 bits and 3 bits) while maintaining high accuracy. On the hardware side, BitMoD employs a bit-serial processing element to easily support multiple numerical precisions and data types; our hardware design includes two key innovations: First, it employs a unified representation to process different weight data types, thus reducing the hardware cost. Second, it adopts a bit-serial dequantization unit to rescale the per-group partial sum with minimal hardware overhead. Our evaluation on six representative LLMs demonstrates that BitMoD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM quantization and acceleration methods. For discriminative tasks, BitMoD can quantize LLM weights to 4-bit with $<\\!0.5\\%$ accuracy loss on average. For generative tasks, BitMoD is able to quantize LLM weights to 3-bit while achieving better perplexity than prior LLM quantization scheme. Combining the superior model performance with an efficient accelerator design, BitMoD achieves an average of $1.69\\times$ and $1.48\\times$ speedups compared to prior LLM accelerators ANT and OliVe, respectively.",

The empirical findings demonstrate how automated voter counting can enhance voting processes and rebuild public confidence in election outcomes, particularly in places where trust is low. The study also emphasizes how rigorous metrics, such as the F1 score, should be used to systematically compare the accuracy of automated systems against manual counting methods. This methodology enables a detailed comprehension of the differences in performance between automated and human counting techniques by providing a nuanced assessment. The incorporation of said measures serves to reinforce an extensive assessment structure, guaranteeing the legitimacy and dependability of automated voting systems inside the electoral sphere.",

In industry, a wide-used modeling architecture is a cascading paradigm: (1) first pre-training a multi-modal model to provide omnipotent representations for downstream services; (2) The downstream recommendation model takes the multi-modal representation as additional input to fit real user-item behaviours. Although such paradigm achieves remarkable improvements, however, there still exist two problems that limit model performance: (1) Representation Unmatching: The pre-trained multi-modal model is always supervised by the classic NLP/CV tasks, while the recommendation models are supervised by real user-item interaction. As a result, the two fundamentally different tasks' goals were relatively separate, and there was a lack of consistent objective on their representations; (2) Representation Unlearning: The generated multi-modal representations are always stored in cache store and serve as extra fixed input of recommendation model, thus could not be updated by recommendation model gradient, further unfriendly for downstream training. Inspired by the two difficulties challenges in downstream tasks usage, we introduce a quantitative multi-modal framework to customize the specialized and trainable multi-modal information for different downstream models.",

As opposed to contemporary approaches which design the elasticity internal to the actuator housing, PANDORA's structural components are designed to be compliant under load or, in other words, structurally elastic. To maintain the rapid design benefit of additive manufacturing, this joint control strategy employs a disturbance observer (DOB) modeled from an ideal elastic actuator. This robust controller treats the model variation from the structurally elastic components as a disturbance and eliminates the need for system identification of the 3D printed parts. This enables mechanical design engineers to iterate on the 3D printed linkages without requiring consistent tuning from the joint controller. Two sets of hardware results are presented for validating the controller. The first set of results are conducted on an ideal elastic actuator testbed that drives an unmodeled, 1 DoF weighted pendulum with a 10 kg mass. The results support the claim that the DOB can handle significant model variation. The second set of results is from a robust balancing experiment conducted on the 12 DoF lower body of PANDORA. The robot maintains balance while an operator applies 50 N pushes to the pelvis, where the actuator tracking results are presented for the left leg.",

This paper presents a new, integrated heuristic-based active sensing and Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based retrieval planning approach. These components provide feedback to one another to actively sense critical, unobserved areas suitable for the retrieval planner to plan a sequence for relocating path-blocking obstacles and a collision-free trajectory for retrieving the target object. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using a robot arm equipped with an in-hand camera in both simulated and real-world confined, cluttered scenarios. Our framework is compared against various state-of-the-art methods. The results indicate that our proposed approach outperforms baseline methods by a significant margin in terms of the success rate, the object rearrangement planning time consumption and the number of planning trials before successfully retrieving the target.

The second experiment evaluates the susceptibility of LLMs to align with predefined ethical frameworks by prompting them to adopt specific value alignments rooted in established philosophical theories. The results demonstrate that LLMs can indeed be persuaded in morally charged scenarios, with the success of persuasion depending on factors such as the model used, the complexity of the scenario, and the conversation length. Notably, LLMs of distinct sizes but from the same company produced markedly different outcomes, highlighting the variability in their susceptibility to ethical persuasion.",

In this paper, we propose a generalisation of the advanced colour passing (ACP) algorithm, which is the state of the art to construct a parametric factor graph. Our proposed algorithm allows for potentials of factors to be scaled arbitrarily and efficiently detects more symmetries than the original ACP algorithm. By detecting strictly more symmetries than ACP, our algorithm significantly reduces online query times for probabilistic inference when the resulting model is applied, which we also confirm in our experiments.",

We prove a very general lower bound on the maximum relative rank of finite subsets relative to algebraic subsets of bounded degree and dimension which is independent of the dimension of the vector space or algebra.

However, standard alignment methods often struggle with step generalization when directly applied to few-step diffusion models, leading to inconsistent performance across different denoising step scenarios. To address this, we introduce Stepwise Diffusion Policy Optimization (SDPO), a novel alignment method tailored for few-step diffusion models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on a single sparse reward from only the final step of each denoising trajectory for trajectory-level optimization, SDPO incorporates dense reward feedback at every intermediate step. By learning the differences in dense rewards between paired samples, SDPO facilitates stepwise optimization of few-step diffusion models, ensuring consistent alignment across all denoising steps. To promote stable and efficient training, SDPO introduces an online reinforcement learning framework featuring several novel strategies designed to effectively exploit the stepwise granularity of dense rewards. Experimental results demonstrate that SDPO consistently outperforms prior methods in reward-based alignment across diverse step configurations, underscoring its robust step generalization capabilities.

So far, these type of wideband measurements are not found in the literature. Periodic orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFMD) sounding signals using Zadoff-Chu sequences have been specially designed for this purpose. The collected data has been post-processed to estimate the time-variant impulse and frequency responses and relevant parameters for system design like the time coherence, bandwidth coherence, delay spread and Doppler bandwidth. The statistical behavior of the channel gain random fluctuation has also been analyzed. This information has been extracted for both the global channel and each path separately. The wide bandwidth of the measurements have allowed the characterization of the channel in a scarcely explored ultrasonic band with an accuracy that is far beyond what is reported in previous works.",

NeuralMag is particularly well-suited for solving inverse problems, especially those with time-dependent objectives, thanks to its automatic differentiation capabilities.

LSTM models were used to predict shear Reynolds stresses in both developed and developing turbulent channel flows, and these predictions were propagated through RANS simulations to obtain mean flow fields of turbulent flows. A comparative analysis was conducted, juxtaposing the LSTM results from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with outcomes from the $\u03ba-\u03b5$ model and data from direct numerical simulations (DNS). These initial findings indicated promising performance of the LSTM approach.\n  This second phase delves further into the challenges encountered and presents robust solutions. Additionally, new results are provided, demonstrating the efficacy of the LSTM model in predicting turbulent behavior in perturbed flows. While the overall study serves as a proof-of-concept for the application of LSTM networks in RANS turbulence modeling, this phase offers compelling evidence of its potential in handling more complex flow scenarios.",

        "abstract": "The dual of a planar graph $G$ is a planar graph $G^*$ that has a vertex for each face of $G$ and an edge for each pair of adjacent faces of $G$. The profound relationship between a planar graph and its dual has been the algorithmic basis for solving numerous (centralized) classical problems on planar graphs. In the distributed setting however, the only use of planar duality is for finding a recursive decomposition of $G$ [DISC 2017, STOC 2019].\n  We extend the distributed algorithmic toolkit to work on the dual graph $G^*$. These tools can then facilitate various algorithms on $G$ by solving a suitable dual problem on $G^*$.\n  Given a directed planar graph $G$ with positive and negative edge-lengths and hop-diameter $D$, our key result is an $\\tilde{O}(D^2)$-round algorithm for Single Source Shortest Paths on $G^*$, which then implies an $\\tilde{O}(D^2)$-round algorithm for Maximum $st$-Flow on $G$. Prior to our work, no $\\tilde{O}(\\text{poly}(D))$-round algorithm was known for Maximum $st$-Flow. We further obtain a $D\\cdot n^{o(1)}$-rounds $(1-\u03b5)$-approximation algorithm for Maximum $st$-Flow on $G$ when $G$ is undirected and $st$-planar. Finally, we give a near optimal $\\tilde O(D)$-round algorithm for computing the weighted girth of $G$.\n  The main challenges in our work are that $G^*$ is not the communication graph (e.g., a vertex of $G$ is mapped to multiple vertices of $G^*$), and that the diameter of $G^*$ can be much larger than $D$ (i.e., possibly by a linear factor). We overcome these challenges by carefully defining and maintaining subgraphs of the dual graph $G^*$ while applying the recursive decomposition on the primal graph $G$. The main technical difficulty, is that along the recursive decomposition, a face of $G$ gets shattered into (disconnected) components yet we still need to treat it as a dual node.",

The distinct metadata requirements necessitate specialized network architectures, leading to architectural incompatibilities that increase deployment complexity. In this paper, we propose RAWMamba, a Mamba-based unified framework developed for sRGB-to-RAW de-rendering across both image and video domains. The core of RAWMamba is the Unified Metadata Embedding (UME) module, which harmonizes diverse metadata types into a unified representation. In detail, a multi-perspective affinity modeling method is proposed to promote the extraction of reference information. In addition, we introduce the Local Tone-Aware Mamba (LTA-Mamba) module, which captures long-range dependencies to enable effective global propagation of metadata. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RAWMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding high-quality RAW data reconstruction.",

To address this challenge, we propose a skill library framework based on knowledge graphs, which endows robots with high-level skill awareness and spatial semantic understanding. The framework hierarchically organizes operational knowledge by constructing a \"task graph\" and a \"scene graph\" to represent task and scene semantic information, respectively. We introduce a \"state graph\" to facilitate interaction between high-level task planning and low-level scene information. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical transfer framework for operational skills. At the task level, the framework integrates contextual learning and chain-of-thought prompting within a four-stage prompt paradigm, leveraging large language models' (LLMs) reasoning and generalization capabilities to achieve task-level subtask sequence transfer. At the motion level, an adaptive trajectory transfer method is developed using the A* algorithm and the skill library, enabling motion-level adaptive trajectory transfer. At the physical level, we introduce an adaptive contour extraction and posture perception method based on tactile perception. This method dynamically obtains high-precision contour and posture information from visual-tactile texture data and adjusts transferred skills, such as contact positions and postures, to ensure effectiveness in new environments.

To accomplish this, FedCoLLM utilizes lightweight adapters in conjunction with SLMs, facilitating knowledge exchange between server and clients in a manner that respects data privacy while also minimizing computational and communication overhead. Our evaluation of FedCoLLM, utilizing various public LLMs and SLMs across a range of NLP text generation tasks, reveals that the performance of clients' SLMs experiences notable improvements with the assistance of the LLMs. Simultaneously, the LLMs enhanced via FedCoLLM achieves comparable performance to that obtained through direct fine-tuning on clients' data.",

We carefully collect images from various movies that contain multiple characters and manually generate the multi-concept question-answer samples. Our dataset features diverse movie types and question-answer types.

This shift in Bitcoin's incentivization mechanism, which introduces volatility into block rewards, could lead to the emergence of new security threats or intensify existing ones. Previous security analyses of Bitcoin have either considered a fixed block reward model or a highly simplified volatile model, overlooking the complexities of Bitcoin's mempool behavior.\n  In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning-based tool designed to analyze mining strategies under a more realistic volatile model. Our tool uses the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm to derive near-optimal mining strategies while interacting with an environment that models the complexity of the Bitcoin mempool. This tool enables the analysis of adversarial mining strategies, such as selfish mining and undercutting, both before and after difficulty adjustments, providing insights into the effects of mining attacks in both the short and long term.\n  Our analysis reveals that Bitcoin users' trend of offering higher fees to speed up the inclusion of their transactions in the chain can incentivize payoff-maximizing miners to deviate from the honest strategy. In the fixed reward model, a disincentive for the selfish mining attack is the initial loss period of at least two weeks, during which the attack is not profitable. However, our analysis shows that once the protocol reward diminishes to zero in the future, or even currently on days when transaction fees are comparable to the protocol reward, mining pools might be incentivized to abandon honest mining to gain an immediate profit.",

First, we derive a new information structure of the NRDF for Markov sources and single-letter distortions. Second, we derive new convexity results on the NRDF, which facilitate the use of Lagrange duality theorem to cast the problem as an unconstrained partially observable finite-time horizon stochastic dynamic programming (DP) algorithm subject to a probabilistic state (belief state) that summarizes the past information about the reproduction symbols and takes values in a continuous state space. Instead of approximating the DP algorithm directly, we use Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions to find an implicit closed-form expression of the optimal control policy of the stochastic DP (i.e., the minimizing distribution of the NRDF) and approximate the control policy and the cost-to-go function (a function of the rate) stage-wise, via a novel dynamic alternating minimization (AM) approach, that is realized by an offline algorithm operating using backward recursions, with provable convergence guarantees. We obtain the clean values of the aforementioned quantities using an online (forward) algorithm operating for any finite-time horizon. Our methodology provides an approximate solution to the exact NRDF solution, which becomes near-optimal as the search space of the belief state becomes sufficiently large at each time stage. We corroborate our theoretical findings with simulation studies where we apply our algorithms assuming time-varying and time-invariant binary Markov processes.",

In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing the Mean-Square Bipower Variation Error (MSBVE) algorithm, which enhances robustness and convergence in scenarios involving significant stochastic noise and jumps. We first revisit the Mean-Square TD Error (MSTDE) algorithm, commonly used in continuous-time RL, and highlight its limitations in handling jumps in state dynamics. The proposed MSBVE algorithm minimizes the mean-square quadratic variation error, offering improved performance over MSTDE in environments characterized by SDEs with jumps. Simulations and formal proofs demonstrate that the MSBVE algorithm reliably estimates the value function in complex settings, surpassing MSTDE's performance when faced with jump processes. These findings underscore the importance of alternative error metrics to improve the resilience and effectiveness of RL algorithms in continuous-time frameworks.",

The approach maps the valley Hamiltonian to a Landau-Zener problem to model the nonadiabatic dynamics in regions of small valley splitting. An optimization refines the shuttling velocity profile over a single small segment of the shuttling path. The protocol reliably returns the valley state to the ground state at the end of the shuttle, disentangling the spin and valley degrees of freedom, after which a single virtual $z$-rotation on the spin compensates its evolution during the shuttle. The time cost and complexity of the error suppression is minimal and independent of the distance over which the spin is shuttled, and the maximum velocities imposed by valley physics are found to be orders of magnitude larger than current experimentally achievable shuttling speeds. This protocol offers a chip-scale solution for high-fidelity quantum transport in silicon spin-based quantum computing devices.",

By allocating more computational resources during the inference phase, large language models~(LLMs) can extensively explore the solution space by generating more thought tokens or diverse solutions, thereby producing more accurate responses. However, developing an o1-like reasoning approach is challenging, and researchers have been making various attempts to advance this open area of research. In this paper, we present a preliminary exploration into enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs through reward-guided tree search algorithms. This framework is implemented by integrating the policy model, reward model, and search algorithm. It is primarily constructed around a tree search algorithm, where the policy model navigates a dynamically expanding tree guided by a specially trained reward model. We thoroughly explore various design considerations necessary for implementing this framework and provide a detailed report of the technical aspects. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we focus on mathematical reasoning tasks and conduct extensive evaluations on four challenging datasets, significantly enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs.",

The lack of such research is primarily attributed to the absence of a large-scale dataset fit for training a degradation-robust generalizable NeRF model. To address this gap and facilitate investigations into the degradation robustness of 3D reconstruction tasks, we construct the Objaverse Blur Dataset, comprising 50,000 images from over 1000 settings featuring multiple levels of blur degradation. In addition, we design a simple and model-agnostic module for enhancing the degradation robustness of GNeRFs. Specifically, by extracting 3D-aware features through a lightweight depth estimator and denoiser, the proposed module shows improvement on different popular methods in GNeRFs in terms of both quantitative and visual quality over varying degradation types and levels.

The main challenge arises from the non-Euclidean nature of the output space, which generally requires relaxing the problem formulation. Surrogate methods build on kernel-induced losses or more generally, loss functions admitting an Implicit Loss Embedding, and convert the original problem into a regression task followed by a decoding step. However, designing effective losses for objects with complex structures presents significant challenges and often requires domain-specific expertise. In this work, we introduce a novel framework in which a structured loss function, parameterized by neural networks, is learned directly from output training data through Contrastive Learning, prior to addressing the supervised surrogate regression problem. As a result, the differentiable loss not only enables the learning of neural networks due to the finite dimension of the surrogate space but also allows for the prediction of new structures of the output data via a decoding strategy based on gradient descent. Numerical experiments on supervised graph prediction problems show that our approach achieves similar or even better performance than methods based on a pre-defined kernel.",

We claim that the effectiveness of process supervision significantly depends on both the accuracy and the length of reasoning chains. Moreover, we identify that these factors exhibit a nonlinear relationship with the overall reward score of the reasoning process. Inspired by these insights, we propose a novel process supervision paradigm, PSPO*, which systematically outlines the workflow from reward model training to policy optimization, and highlights the importance of nonlinear rewards in process supervision. Based on PSPO*, we develop the PSPO-WRS, which considers the number of reasoning steps in determining reward scores and utilizes an adjusted Weibull distribution for nonlinear reward shaping. Experimental results on six mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that PSPO-WRS consistently outperforms current mainstream models.",

        "abstract": "Among adversarial attacks against sequential recommender systems, model extraction attacks represent a method to attack sequential recommendation models without prior knowledge. Existing research has primarily concentrated on the adversary's execution of black-box attacks through data-free model extraction. However, a significant gap remains in the literature concerning the development of surrogate models by adversaries with access to few-shot raw data (10\\% even less). That is, the challenge of how to construct a surrogate model with high functional similarity within the context of few-shot data scenarios remains an issue that requires resolution.This study addresses this gap by introducing a novel few-shot model extraction framework against sequential recommenders, which is designed to construct a superior surrogate model with the utilization of few-shot data. The proposed few-shot model extraction framework is comprised of two components: an autoregressive augmentation generation strategy and a bidirectional repair loss-facilitated model distillation procedure. Specifically, to generate synthetic data that closely approximate the distribution of raw data, autoregressive augmentation generation strategy integrates a probabilistic interaction sampler to extract inherent dependencies and a synthesis determinant signal module to characterize user behavioral patterns. Subsequently, bidirectional repair loss, which target the discrepancies between the recommendation lists, is designed as auxiliary loss to rectify erroneous predictions from surrogate models, transferring knowledge from the victim model to the surrogate model effectively. Experiments on three datasets show that the proposed few-shot model extraction framework yields superior surrogate models.",

This realization leads to the development of the Explanatory Learning (EL) framework, a formalization of the problem faced by a scientist when trying to explain a new phenomenon to their peers. The effective EL prescriptions allow us to crack Zendo, a board game simulating the scientific endeavor. This success comes with a fundamental insight: an artificial scientist must develop its own interpretation of the language used to explain its findings. This perspective then leads us to see modern multimodal models as interpreters, and to devise a new way to build interpretable and cost-effective CLIP-like models: by coupling two unimodal models using little multimodal data and no further training. Finally, we discuss what ChatGPT and its siblings are still missing to become artificial scientists, and introduce Odeen, a benchmark about interpreting explanations that sees LLMs going no further than random chance while being instead fully solved by humans.",

This frequently causes robustness issues and hallucinations, leading to performance degradation. Data valuation is an efficient way to detect and trace these misalignments. Nevertheless, existing methods are computationally expensive for MLLMs. While computationally efficient, the classical influence functions are inadequate for contrastive learning models because they were originally designed for pointwise loss. Additionally, contrastive learning involves minimizing the distance between the modalities of positive samples and maximizing the distance between the modalities of negative samples. This requires us to evaluate the influence of samples from both perspectives. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Extended Influence Function for Contrastive Loss (ECIF), an influence function crafted for contrastive loss. ECIF considers both positive and negative samples and provides a closed-form approximation of contrastive learning models, eliminating the need for retraining. Building upon ECIF, we develop a series of algorithms for data evaluation in MLLM, misalignment detection, and misprediction trace-back tasks. Experimental results demonstrate our ECIF advances the transparency and interpretability of MLLMs by offering a more accurate assessment of data impact and model alignment compared to traditional baseline methods.",

In particular, for $G/K=U(n)/U(k)\\times U(n-k)$, we obtain a new way of multiplying Schur polynomials, i.e., computing the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. The corresponding multiplication on the Clifford algebra side is, in a convenient basis given by projections of the spin module, simply the componentwise multiplication of vectors in $\\mathbb{C}^N$, also known as the Hadamard product.",

In particular, no existing program logics can express specifications about the distributions of outcomes resulting from programs that are both probabilistic and concurrent. To address this, we introduce Probabilistic Concurrent Outcome Logic, which incorporates ideas from concurrent and probabilistic separation logics into Outcome Logic to introduce new compositional reasoning principles.",

        "abstract": "We extend the recently introduced single-boson exchange formulation to the computation of the self-energy from the Schwinger-Dyson equation (SDE). In particular, we derive its expression both in diagrammatic and in physical channels. The simple form of the single-boson exchange SDE, involving only the bosonic propagator and the fermion-boson vertex, but not the rest function, allows for an efficient numerical implementation. We furthermore discuss its implications in a truncated unity solver, where a restricted number of form factors introduces an information loss in the projection of the momentum dependence that in general affects the equivalence between the different channel representations. In the application to the functional renormalization group, we find that the pseudogap opening in the two-dimensional Hubbard model at weak coupling is captured only in the magnetic channel representation of the SDE, while its expressions in terms of the density and superconducting channels fail to correctly account for the driving antiferromagnetic fluctuations.",

        "abstract": "The application of Tensor Networks (TN) in quantum computing has shown promise, particularly for data loading. However, the assumption that data is readily available often renders the integration of TN techniques into Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) inefficient, as complete probability distributions would have to be calculated classically. In this paper the tensor-train cross approximation (TT-cross) algorithm is evaluated as a means to address the probability loading problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on financial distributions, showcasing the TT-cross approach's scalability and accuracy. Our results indicate that the TT-cross method significantly improves circuit depth scalability compared to traditional methods, offering a more efficient pathway for implementing QMC on near-term quantum hardware. The approach also shows high accuracy and scalability in handling high-dimensional financial data, making it a promising solution for quantum finance applications.",

        "abstract": "The changesets (or patches) that fix open source software vulnerabilities form critical datasets for various machine learning security-enhancing applications, such as automated vulnerability patching and silent fix detection. These patch datasets are derived from extensive collections of historical vulnerability fixes, maintained in databases like the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list and the National Vulnerability Database. However, since these databases focus on rapid notification to the security community, they contain significant inaccuracies and omissions that have a negative impact on downstream software security quality assurance tasks.\n  In this paper, we propose an approach employing Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) to curate datasets of publicly-available software vulnerability patches. Our methodology leverages machine learning models that incorporate UQ to differentiate between patches based on their potential utility. We begin by evaluating a number of popular UQ techniques, including Vanilla, Monte Carlo Dropout, and Model Ensemble, as well as homoscedastic and heteroscedastic models of noise. Our findings indicate that Model Ensemble and heteroscedastic models are the best choices for vulnerability patch datasets. Based on these UQ modeling choices, we propose a heuristic that uses UQ to filter out lower quality instances and select instances with high utility value from the vulnerability dataset. Using our approach, we observe an improvement in predictive performance and significant reduction of model training time (i.e., energy consumption) for a state-of-the-art vulnerability prediction model.",
