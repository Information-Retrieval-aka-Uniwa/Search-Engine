        "abstract": "We study the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) from density fluctuations due to supercooled phase transitions (PTs) triggered in an axion-like particle (ALP) model. We find that the mass of the PBHs is inversely correlated with the ALP decay constant $f_a$. For instance, for $f_a$ varying from ${\\cal O}$(100 MeV) to ${\\cal O}$($10^{12}$ GeV), the PBH mass varies between $(10^{3} - 10^{-24}) M_{\\odot}$. We then identify the ALP parameter space where the PBH can account for the entire (or partial) dark matter fraction of the Universe, in a single (multi-component) dark matter scenario, with the ALP being the other dark matter candidate. The PBH parameter space ruled out by current cosmological and microlensing observations can thus be directly mapped onto the ALP parameter space, thus providing new bounds on ALPs, complementary to the laboratory and astrophysical ALP constraints. Similarly, depending on the ALP couplings to other Standard Model particles, the ALP constraints on $f_a$ can be translated into a lower bound on the PBH mass scale. Moreover, the supercooled PT leads to a potentially observable stochastic gravitational wave (GW) signal at future GW observatories, such as aLIGO, LISA and ET, that acts as another complementary probe of the ALPs, as well as of the PBH dark matter. Finally, we show that the recent NANOGrav signal of stochastic GW in the nHz frequency range can be explained in our model with $f_a\\simeq (10~{\\rm GeV}-1~{\\rm TeV})$.",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis based on the standard model only and explaining the coincidence between the baryon and dark matter densities in the Universe, as well as the observed value of the baryon-to-photon ratio. In our scenario, large curvature fluctuations slightly below the threshold for Primordial Black Hole (PBH) formation locally reheat the plasma above the sphaleron barrier when they collapse gravitationally but without forming a black hole. This rapid process can lead to a maximal baryogenesis in those regions at the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) epoch at thermal temperatures between 20 MeV and 50 MeV. Compared to another mechanism relying on shock waves associated to the formation of PBHs, our mechanism instead applies to aborted PBHs. Using simulations in numerical relativity, we calculate the overdensity threshold for baryogenesis and show that the baryon-to-photon ratio is generically between two and three times larger than the relative abundance of PBHs formed at those temperatures. Finally, we show that PBH formation models at the QCD epoch leading to an abundance comparable to the dark matter could have generated a baryon density and an averaged baryon-to-photon ratio consistent with observations.",

        "abstract": "We carry out three dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to study the role of gravitational and drag forces on the concentration of large dust grains (St > 1) in the spiral arms of gravitationally unstable protoplanetary discs, and the resulting implications for planet formation. We find that both drag and gravity play an important role in the evolution of large dust grains. If we include both, grains that would otherwise be partially decoupled will become well coupled and trace the spirals. For the dust grains most influenced by drag (with Stokes numbers near unity), the dust disc quickly becomes gravitationally unstable and rapidly forms clumps with masses between 0.15 - 6 Earth masses. A large fraction of clumps are below the threshold where runaway gas accretion can occur. However, if dust self-gravity is neglected, the dust is unable to form clumps, despite still becoming trapped in the gas spirals. When large dust grains are unable to feel either gas gravity or drag, the dust is unable to trace the gas spirals. Hence, full physics is needed to properly simulate dust in gravitationally unstable discs.\nDust trapping of large grains in spiral arms of discs stable to gas fragmentation could explain planet formation in very young discs by a population of planetesimals formed due to the combined roles of drag and gravity in the earliest stages of a disc's evolution. Furthermore, it highlights that gravitationally unstable discs are not just important for forming gas giants quickly, it can also rapidly form Earth mass bodies.",

        "abstract": "We discuss the possible association of an astrophysical neutrino (IC220405B) with the recently reported, extremely energetic tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate AT2021lwx (ZTF20abrbeie, aka ``Scary Barbie'') at redshift $z=0.995$. Although the TDE is about $2.6^\\circ$ off the direction of the reconstructed neutrino event (${outside}$ the 90% C.L. localization region), the TDE candidate shares some important characteristics with so far reported neutrino-TDE associations: a strong infrared dust echo, high bolometric luminosity, a neutrino time delay with respect to the peak mass accretion rate of the order of hundred days, and a high observed X-ray luminosity. We interpret this new association using an isotropic emission model, where neutrinos are produced by the collision of accelerated protons with infrared photons. After accounting for the high redshift of AT2021lwx (by interpreting the data in the SMBH frame), we find that the expected neutrino fluences and neutrino time delays are qualitatively comparable to the other TDEs. Since data are only available up to 300 days post-peak in the SMBH frame, significant uncertainties exist in the dust echo interpretation, and therefore in the predicted number of neutrinos detected, $\\mathcal N_{\\nu}\\simeq3.0\\times10^{-3}-0.012$. We recommend further follow-up on this object for an extended period, and suggest refining the reconstruction the neutrino arrival direction in this particular case.",

        "abstract": "We explore binary asteroid formation by spin-up and rotational disruption considering the NASA DART mission's encounter with the Didymos-Dimorphos binary, which was the first small binary visited by a spacecraft. Using a suite of $N$-body simulations, we follow the gravitational accumulation of a satellite from meter-sized particles following a mass-shedding event from a rapidly rotating primary. The satellite's formation is chaotic, as it undergoes a series of collisions, mergers, and close gravitational encounters with other moonlets, leading to a wide range of outcomes in terms of the satellite's mass, shape, orbit, and rotation state. We find that a Dimorphos-like satellite can form rapidly, in a matter of days, following a realistic mass-shedding event in which only ${\\sim}2-3\\%$ of the primary's mass is shed. Satellites can form in synchronous rotation due to their formation near the Roche limit. There is a strong preference for forming prolate (elongated) satellites, although some simulations result in oblate spheroids like Dimorphos. The distribution of simulated secondary shapes is broadly consistent with other binary systems, measured through radar or lightcurves. Unless Dimorphos's shape is an outlier, and considering the observational bias against lightcurve-based determination of secondary elongations for oblate bodies, we suggest there could be a significant population of oblate secondaries. If these satellites initially form with elongated shapes, a yet-unidentified pathway is needed to explain how they become oblate. Finally, we show that this chaotic formation pathway occasionally forms asteroid pairs and stable triples, including co-orbital satellites and satellites in mean motion resonances.",

We are using different algorithms for detecting gaps in colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), including the k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) and UniDip algorithms. We propose using a combination of the k-NN algorithm and the UniDip algorithm and manual verification to identify gaps unlikely to be of a statistical origin. Using the $Gaia$ photometric system, i.e. BP-RP, we took the data of 130 star clusters and searched for gaps in the ranges of 0.40 to 0.47 mag, and 0.56 to 0.60 mag, respectively. We analysed all data statistically and identified the gaps in the individual clusters. Finally, we applied the kernel density estimator to see how the gaps are distributed.",

        "abstract": "  Using high precision parallaxes from the Hipparcos catalog, we construct H-R diagrams for two samples of bright stars. The first is a magnitude-limited sample that is over 90% complete and uses uniform photometry from the Catalog of WBVR Magnitudes of Northern Sky Bright Stars (declination above -14 deg). This sample shows a smooth distribution of stars along the main sequence, with no detectable gaps. The second contains all of the stars closer than 100 parsecs in the Hipparcos catalog with declination less than -12 deg. Uniform spectroscopy from the Michigan Spectral Survey shows that some stars which appear on the main sequence in the H-R diagram, particularly those in the 0.2 < B-V < 0.3 region that has been labeled the Bohm-Vitense gap, are classified as giants by the MK system of spectral classification. Other gaps that have been identified in the main sequence are also affected by such classification criteria. This analysis casts doubt on the existence of the Bohm-Vitense gap, which is thought to result from the sudden onset of convection in stars. The standard identification of main sequence stars with luminosity class V, and giants with luminosity class III, must be reconsidered for some spectral types. The true nature of the stars that lie on the main sequence in the H-R diagram, but which do not have luminosity class V designations, remains to be investigated.",

        "abstract": "Recent works have used a linear birth metallicity gradient to estimate the evolution of the [Fe/H] profile in the Galactic disk over time, and infer stellar birth radii (R$_\\text{birth}$) from [Fe/H] and age measurements. These estimates rely on the evolution of [Fe/H] at the Galactic center ([Fe/H](0, $\\tau$)) and the birth metallicity gradient ($\\nabla$[Fe/H]($\\tau)$) over time -- quantities that are unknown and inferred under key assumptions. In this work, we use the sample of Milky Way/Andromeda analogues from the TNG50 simulation to investigate the ability to recover [Fe/H](R, $\\tau$) and R$_\\text{birth}$ in a variety of galaxies. Using stellar disk particles, we test the assumptions required in estimating R$_\\text{birth}$, [Fe/H](0, $\\tau$), and $\\nabla$[Fe/H]($\\tau)$ using recently proposed methods to understand when they are valid. We show that $\\nabla$[Fe/H]($\\tau)$ can be recovered in most galaxies to within 22% from the range in [Fe/H] across age, with better accuracy for more massive and stronger barred galaxies. We also find that the true central metallicity is unrepresentative of the genuine disk [Fe/H] profile; thus we propose to use a projected central metallicity instead. About half of the galaxies in our sample do not have a continuously enriching projected central metallicity, with a dilution in [Fe/H] correlating with mergers. Most importantly, galaxy-specific [Fe/H](R, $\\tau$) can be constrained and confirmed by requiring the R$_\\text{birth}$ distributions of mono-age, solar neighborhood populations to follow inside-out formation. We conclude that examining trends with R$_\\text{birth}$ is valid for the Milky Way disk and similarly structured galaxies, where we expect R$_\\text{birth}$ can be recovered to within 16% assuming today's measurement uncertainties in TNG50.",

We accomplished this by employing the equivalent width (EW) method and high-resolution spectroscopic data. Furthermore, we investigated the distributions of [X/Fe] ratios and [C/O] as a function of metallicity ([Fe/H]) and kinematic population. The observed trends are consistent with previous findings reported in the literature. Additionally, we searched for confirmed exoplanets around our primary stars in the literature and found 24 exoplanets in 17 systems, while none of the M-dwarf companions in our sample presented confirmed exoplanets. In conclusion, our study provides homogeneous abundances from high-resolution spectra for a large sample of FGK primary stars, paving the way for further research on stellar abundances of the M secondaries and exoplanetary science.",

Here we focus on the realization of a sector of such a lens made of 11 bent Germanium crystals and describe the technological challenges involved in their positioning and alignment with adhesive-based bonding techniques. The accurate alignment and the uniformity of the curvature of the crystals are critical for achieving optimal X-ray focusing capabilities. We have assessed how the errors of misalignment with respect to the main orientation angles of the crystals affect the point spread function (PSF) of the image diffracted by a single sector. We have corroborated these results with simulations carried out with our physical model of the lens, based on a Monte Carlo ray-tracing technique, adopting the geometrical configuration of the Laue sector, the observed assembly accuracy and the measured curvatures of the crystals. An extrapolation of the performances achieved on a single sector to an entire Laue lens based on this model has shown that a PSF with half-power-diameter of 4.8 arcmin can be achieved with current technology. This has the potential to lead to a significant improvement in sensitivity of spectroscopic and polarimetric observations in the 50-600 keV band",
