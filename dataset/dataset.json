        "abstract": "Since the start of the operational use of ensemble prediction systems, ensemble-based probabilistic forecasting has become the most advanced approach in weather prediction. However, despite the persistent development of the last three decades, ensemble forecasts still often suffer from the lack of calibration and might exhibit systematic bias, which calls for some form of statistical post-processing. Nowadays, one can choose from a large variety of post-processing approaches, where parametric methods provide full predictive distributions of the investigated weather quantity. Parameter estimation in these models is based on training data consisting of past forecast-observation pairs, thus post-processed forecasts are usually available only at those locations where training data are accessible. We propose a general clustering-based interpolation technique of extending calibrated predictive distributions from observation stations to any location in the ensemble domain where there are ensemble forecasts at hand. Focusing on the ensemble model output statistics (EMOS) post-processing technique, in a case study based on wind speed ensemble forecasts of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, we demonstrate the predictive performance of various versions of the suggested method and show its superiority over the regionally estimated and interpolated EMOS models and the raw ensemble forecasts as well.",

The exact finite-time distribution of charge fluctuations is obtained in terms of a dressing transformation acting on the finite-time distribution of particle fluctuations. The transformation is mapped to a simple substitution rule for corresponding full-counting statistics. By taking the asymptotics of the dressing transformation we analyze typical and large scale charge fluctuations. Typical charge fluctuations in equilibrium states with vanishing mean charge are anomalous while large charge fluctuations undergo first and second order dynamical phase transitions out of equilibrium.",

However, their spatial coverage is generally sparse and unevenly distributed across the globe. Statistical interpolation methods are the prevalent techniques to grid such data, but these purely data-driven approaches sometimes produce results that are incoherent with our knowledge of the physical world. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) follow an innovative approach to data analysis and physical modeling through machine learning, as they incorporate physical principles into the data-driven learning process. Here, we develop PINNs to reconstruct global maps of atmospheric dust surface deposition fluxes from measurement data in paleoclimatic archives, for the Holocene and Last Glacial Maximum periods. We design an advection-diffusion equation to consider dominant wind directions at various latitudes, which prevents dust particles from flowing upwind. Our PINN improves on standard kriging interpolation by allowing variable asymmetry around data points. The reconstructions display realistic dust plumes from continental sources towards ocean basins following prevailing winds.",

These limitations significantly constrain policymakers' ability to fully comprehend policy impacts and design future interventions. In this study, we propose innovative estimators for causal effect curves within the DiD framework, accounting for multiple sources of confounding. Our approach accommodates misspecification of a subset of treatment, exposure, and outcome models while avoiding any parametric assumptions on the effect curve.

        "abstract": "There has recently been an explosion of interest in how \"higher-order\" structures emerge in complex systems. This \"emergent\" organization has been found in a variety of natural and artificial systems, although at present the field lacks a unified understanding of what the consequences of higher-order synergies and redundancies are for systems. Typical research treat the presence (or absence) of synergistic information as a dependent variable and report changes in the level of synergy in response to some change in the system. Here, we attempt to flip the script: rather than treating higher-order information as a dependent variable, we use evolutionary optimization to evolve boolean networks with significant higher-order redundancies, synergies, or statistical complexity. We then analyse these evolved populations of networks using established tools for characterizing discrete dynamics: the number of attractors, average transient length, and Derrida coefficient. We also assess the capacity of the systems to integrate information. We find that high-synergy systems are unstable and chaotic, but with a high capacity to integrate information. In contrast, evolved redundant systems are extremely stable, but have negligible capacity to integrate information. Finally, the complex systems that balance integration and segregation (known as Tononi-Sporns-Edelman complexity) show features of both chaosticity and stability, with a greater capacity to integrate information than the redundant systems while being more stable than the random and synergistic systems. We conclude that there may be a fundamental trade-off between the robustness of a systems dynamics and its capacity to integrate information (which inherently requires flexibility and sensitivity), and that certain kinds of complexity naturally balance this trade-off.",

        "abstract": "The physics of solar flares occurring on the Sun is highly complex and far from fully understood. However, observations show that solar eruptions are associated with the intense kilogauss fields of active regions, where free energies are stored with field-aligned electric currents. With the advent of high-quality data sources such as the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), recent works on solar flare forecasting have been focusing on data-driven methods. In particular, black box machine learning and deep learning models are increasingly adopted in which underlying data structures are not modeled explicitly. If the active regions indeed follow the same laws of physics, there should be similar patterns shared among them, reflected by the observations. Yet, these black box models currently used in the literature do not explicitly characterize the heterogeneous nature of the solar flare data, within and between active regions. In this paper, we propose two finite mixture models designed to capture the heterogeneous patterns of active regions and their associated solar flare events. With extensive numerical studies, we demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed method for both resolving the sample imbalance issue and modeling the heterogeneity for rare energetic solar flare events.",

Without care, these heterogeneities impede the learning process, most notably, when optimizing fairness objectives. Confirming this, under a gaussian mixture setting, we show that the optimal SVM classifier for balanced accuracy needs to be adaptive to the class attributes. This motivates us to propose CAP: An effective and general method that generates a class-specific learning strategy (e.g. hyperparameter) based on the attributes of that class. This way, optimization process better adapts to heterogeneities. CAP leads to substantial improvements over the naive approach of assigning separate hyperparameters to each class. We instantiate CAP for loss function design and post-hoc logit adjustment, with emphasis on label-imbalanced problems. We show that CAP is competitive with prior art and its flexibility unlocks clear benefits for fairness objectives beyond balanced accuracy. Finally, we evaluate CAP on problems with label noise as well as weighted test objectives to showcase how CAP can jointly adapt to different heterogeneities.",

Since the Langevin sampler requires access to the score function of the underlying graph prior, we use graph neural networks to effectively estimate the score from a graph dataset (either available beforehand or generated from a known distribution). Numerical experiments demonstrate the benefits of our approach.",

        "abstract": "Over the last three decades, case-crossover designs have found many applications in health sciences, especially in air pollution epidemiology. They are typically used, in combination with partial likelihood techniques, to define a conditional logistic model for the responses, usually health outcomes, conditional on the exposures. Despite the fact that conditional logistic models have been shown equivalent, in typical air pollution epidemiology setups, to specific instances of the well-known Poisson time series model, it is often claimed that they cannot allow for overdispersion. This paper clarifies the relationship between case-crossover designs, the models that ensue from their use, and overdispersion. In particular, we propose to relax the assumption of independence between individuals traditionally made in case-crossover analyses, in order to explicitly introduce overdispersion in the conditional logistic model. As we show, the resulting overdispersed conditional logistic model coincides with the overdispersed, conditional Poisson model, in the sense that their likelihoods are simple re-expressions of one another. We further provide the technical details of a Bayesian implementation of the proposed case-crossover model, which we use to demonstrate, by means of a large simulation study, that standard case-crossover models can lead to dramatically underestimated coverage probabilities, while the proposed models do not. We also perform an illustrative analysis of the association between air pollution and morbidity in Toronto, Canada, which shows that the proposed models are more robust than standard ones to outliers such as those associated with public holidays.",

It reflected short and long-term impacts through linear regression and geographically weighted regression models. Findings indicated that counties with a higher percentage of people using walking and biking during the initial phase of COVID-19 experienced greater reductions in commute trips. For the long-term effect in November, the impact of active modes became insignificant, and individuals using public modes showed more significant trip reductions. Positive correlations were observed between median income levels and reduced commute trips. Sectors requiring ongoing outdoor operations during the pandemic showed substantial negative correlations. In the DMV area, counties with a higher proportion of Democratic voters experienced less trip reduction. Applying Geographically Weighted Regression models captured local spatial relationships, showing the emergence of local correlations as the pandemic evolved, suggesting a geographical impact pattern. Initially global, the pandemic's impact on commuting behaviors became more influenced by spatial factors over time, showing localized effects.",

People create and publicly share their own playlists to express their musical tastes, promote the discovery of their favorite artists, and foster social connections. These publicly accessible playlists transcend the boundaries of mere musical preferences: they serve as sources of rich insights into users' attributes and identities. For example, the musical preferences of elderly individuals may lean more towards Frank Sinatra, while Billie Eilish remains a favored choice among teenagers. These playlists thus become windows into the diverse and evolving facets of one's musical identity.\n  In this work, we investigate the relationship between Spotify users' attributes and their public playlists. In particular, we focus on identifying recurring musical characteristics associated with users' individual attributes, such as demographics, habits, or personality traits. To this end, we conducted an online survey involving 739 Spotify users, yielding a dataset of 10,286 publicly shared playlists encompassing over 200,000 unique songs and 55,000 artists. Through extensive statistical analyses, we first assess a deep connection between a user's Spotify playlists and their real-life attributes. For instance, we found individuals high in openness often create playlists featuring a diverse array of artists, while female users prefer Pop and K-pop music genres. Building upon these observed associations, we create accurate predictive models for users' attributes, presenting a novel DeepSet application that outperforms baselines in most of these users' attributes.",

The problem with these RCT's is that they are costly and this cost increases with the number of individuals included into the RCT. For this reason, there is research how to conduct experiments involving a small number of individuals while still obtaining precise treatment effect estimates. We contribute to this literature a heteroskedasticity-aware stratified sampling (HS) scheme, which leverages the fact that different individuals have different noise levels in their outcome and precise treatment effect estimation requires more observations from the \"high-noise\" individuals than from the \"low-noise\" individuals. By theory as well as by empirical experiments, we demonstrate that our HS-sampling yields significantly more precise estimates of the ATE, improves uplift models and makes their evaluation more reliable compared to RCT data sampled completely randomly. Due to the relative ease of application and the significant benefits, we expect HS-sampling to be valuable in many real-world applications.",

We focus on the non-intrusive setup of the Clarity Prediction Challenge 2 (CPC2), where the task is to predict the percentage of words correctly perceived by hearing-impaired listeners from speech-in-noise recordings. We propose a simple method that learns a lightweight specialized prediction head on top of frozen SFMs to approach the problem. Our results reveal statistically significant differences in performance across SFMs. Our method resulted in the winning submission in the CPC2, demonstrating its promise for speech perception applications.",

        "abstract": "In today's data-driven world, the proliferation of publicly available information intensifies the challenge of information leakage (IL), raising security concerns. IL involves unintentionally exposing secret (sensitive) information to unauthorized parties via systems' observable information. Conventional statistical approaches, which estimate mutual information (MI) between observable and secret information for detecting IL, face challenges such as the curse of dimensionality, convergence, computational complexity, and MI misestimation. Furthermore, emerging supervised machine learning (ML) methods, though effective, are limited to binary system-sensitive information and lack a comprehensive theoretical framework. To address these limitations, we establish a theoretical framework using statistical learning theory and information theory to accurately quantify and detect IL. We demonstrate that MI can be accurately estimated by approximating the log-loss and accuracy of the Bayes predictor. As the Bayes predictor is typically unknown in practice, we propose to approximate it with the help of automated machine learning (AutoML). First, we compare our MI estimation approaches against current baselines, using synthetic data sets generated using the multivariate normal (MVN) distribution with known MI. Second, we introduce a cut-off technique using one-sided statistical tests to detect IL, employing the Holm-Bonferroni correction to increase confidence in detection decisions. Our study evaluates IL detection performance on real-world data sets, highlighting the effectiveness of the Bayes predictor's log-loss estimation, and finds our proposed method to effectively estimate MI on synthetic data sets and thus detect ILs accurately.",

In this paper, we propose an alternative, instance-based approach to the problem. We define the \"Levenshtein difficulty\" of a problem instance $(s,T)$ as the probability that the resulting traces do not provide enough information for correct recovery with full certainty. One can then try to characterize, for a specific $s$, how $T$ needs to scale in order for the Levenshtein difficulty to go to zero, and seek reconstruction algorithms that match this scaling for each $s$. For a class of binary strings with alternating long runs, we precisely characterize the scaling of $T$ for which the Levenshtein difficulty goes to zero. For this class, we also prove that a simple \"Las Vegas algorithm\" has an error probability that decays to zero with the same rate as that with which the Levenshtein difficulty tends to zero.",

Specifically, in the above paper an experiment was presented in which it can be proven that in some individual cases energy is not conserved, despite being conserved statistically. It was felt however that this is worrisome, and that something must be wrong if there are individual instances in which conservation doesn't hold, even though this is not required by the standard conservation law. Here we revisit that experiment and show that although its results are correct, there is a way to circumvent them and ensure individual case conservation in that situation. The solution is however quite unusual, challenging one of the basic assumptions of quantum mechanics, namely that any quantum state can be prepared, and it involves a time-holistic, double non-conservation effect. Our results bring new light on the role of the preparation stage of the initial state of a particle and on the interplay of conservation laws and frames of reference. We also conjecture that when such a full analysis of any conservation experiment is performed, conservation is obeyed in every individual case.",

While many contributions have been made during the last decades, the majority of the literature focuses on parametric INAR models and estimation techniques. Our emphasis is on the complex but efficient and non-restrictive semiparametric estimation of INAR models. The appeal of this approach lies in the absence of a commitment to a parametric family of innovation distributions.

Only the first two elements are usually considered and estimated when working over vast areas. Even then, separate models constitute the standard, with frequency being rarely investigated. Frequency and intensity are intertwined and depend on each other because larger events occur less frequently and vice versa. However, due to the lack of multi-temporal inventories and joint statistical models, modelling such properties via a unified hazard model has always been challenging and has yet to be attempted. Here, we develop a unified model to estimate landslide hazard at the slope unit level to address such gaps. We employed deep learning, combined with a model motivated by extreme-value theory to analyse an inventory of 30 years of observed rainfall-triggered landslides in Nepal and assess landslide hazard for multiple return periods. We also use our model to further explore landslide hazard for the same return periods under different climate change scenarios up to the end of the century. Our results show that the proposed model performs excellently and can be used to model landslide hazard in a unified manner. Geomorphologically, we find that under both climate change scenarios (SSP245 and SSP885), landslide hazard is likely to increase up to two times on average in the lower Himalayan regions while remaining the same in the middle Himalayan region whilst decreasing slightly in the upper Himalayan region areas.",

Moreover, we also find that, for a large number of RIS elements, the RIS-assisted A2G channel can be characterized as a single Rician fading channel. Our results reveal the presence of channel hardening in A2G communication under low UAV speeds, where we derive the maximum target spectral efficiency (SE) for a system to maintain a consistent required outage level. Meanwhile, high UAV speeds, exceeding 50 m/s, lead to a significant performance degradation, which cannot be mitigated by increasing the number of RIS elements.",

        "abstract": "Early detection of melanoma, a potentially lethal type of skin cancer with high prevalence worldwide, improves patient prognosis. In retrospective studies, artificial intelligence (AI) has proven to be helpful for enhancing melanoma detection. However, there are few prospective studies confirming these promising results. Existing studies are limited by low sample sizes, too homogenous datasets, or lack of inclusion of rare melanoma subtypes, preventing a fair and thorough evaluation of AI and its generalizability, a crucial aspect for its application in the clinical setting. Therefore, we assessed 'All Data are Ext' (ADAE), an established open-source ensemble algorithm for detecting melanomas, by comparing its diagnostic accuracy to that of dermatologists on a prospectively collected, external, heterogeneous test set comprising eight distinct hospitals, four different camera setups, rare melanoma subtypes, and special anatomical sites. We advanced the algorithm with real test-time augmentation (R-TTA, i.e. providing real photographs of lesions taken from multiple angles and averaging the predictions), and evaluated its generalization capabilities. Overall, the AI showed higher balanced accuracy than dermatologists (0.798, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.779-0.814 vs. 0.781, 95% CI 0.760-0.802; p<0.001), obtaining a higher sensitivity (0.921, 95% CI 0.900- 0.942 vs. 0.734, 95% CI 0.701-0.770; p<0.001) at the cost of a lower specificity (0.673, 95% CI 0.641-0.702 vs. 0.828, 95% CI 0.804-0.852; p<0.001). As the algorithm exhibited a significant performance advantage on our heterogeneous dataset exclusively comprising melanoma-suspicious lesions, AI may offer the potential to support dermatologists particularly in diagnosing challenging cases.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, it has become increasingly easy to obtain approximate posterior samples via efficient computation algorithms, such as those in variational Bayes. On the other hand, concerns exist on the accuracy of uncertainty estimates, which make it tempting to consider exploiting the approximate samples in canonical Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. A major technical barrier is that the approximate sample, when used as a proposal in Metropolis-Hastings steps, tends to have a low acceptance rate as the dimension increases. In this article, we propose a simple yet general solution named ''graph-accelerated Markov Chain Monte Carlo''. We first build a graph with each node location assigned to an approximate sample, then we run Markov chain Monte Carlo with random walks over the graph. In the first stage, we optimize the choice of graph edges to enforce small differences in posterior density/probability between neighboring nodes, while encouraging edges to correspond to large distances in the parameter space. This optimized graph allows us to accelerate a canonical Markov transition kernel through mixing with a large-jump Metropolis-Hastings step, when collecting Markov chain samples at the second stage. Due to its simplicity, this acceleration can be applied to most of the existing Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. We theoretically quantify the rate of acceptance as dimension increases, and show the effects on improved mixing time. We demonstrate our approach through improved mixing performances for challenging sampling problems, such as those involving multiple modes, non-convex density contour, or large-dimension latent variables.",

Adapted versions that include dummy variables for cluster membership are also included for the tree-based methods. Methods are evaluated for coefficient estimation bias, statistical power, and type I error rates on simulated hierarchical data with different cluster sizes (25 and 50) and levels of missingness (10\\% and 50\\%). Coefficients are estimated using random intercept and random slope models. The results show that while MICE is preferred for accurate rejection rates, Extreme Gradient Boosting is advantageous for reducing bias. Furthermore, the study finds that bias levels are similar across different cluster sizes, but rejection rates tend to be less favorable with fewer clusters (lower power, higher type I error). In addition, the inclusion of cluster dummies in tree-based methods improves estimation for Level 1 variables, but is less effective for Level 2 variables. When data become too complex and MICE is too slow, extreme gradient boosting is a good alternative for hierarchical data.\n  Keywords: Multiple imputation; multi-level data; MICE; missRanger; mixgb",

They typically work by predicting concepts given the input and then predicting the final class label given the predicted concepts. However, (1) they often fail to capture the high-order, nonlinear interaction between concepts, e.g., correcting a predicted concept (e.g., \"yellow breast\") does not help correct highly correlated concepts (e.g., \"yellow belly\"), leading to suboptimal final accuracy; (2) they cannot naturally quantify the complex conditional dependencies between different concepts and class labels (e.g., for an image with the class label \"Kentucky Warbler\" and a concept \"black bill\", what is the probability that the model correctly predicts another concept \"black crown\"), therefore failing to provide deeper insight into how a black-box model works. In response to these limitations, we propose Energy-based Concept Bottleneck Models (ECBMs). Our ECBMs use a set of neural networks to define the joint energy of candidate (input, concept, class) tuples. With such a unified interface, prediction, concept correction, and conditional dependency quantification are then represented as conditional probabilities, which are generated by composing different energy functions. Our ECBMs address both limitations of existing CBMs, providing higher accuracy and richer concept interpretations. Empirical results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on real-world datasets.",

Based on the proposed framework, by considering both instantaneous channel state information (CSI) and statistical CSI, closed-form expressions are derived for sensing rates (SRs), communication rates (CRs), and outage probabilities under different ISAC designs. Further insights are gained by examining high signal-to-noise ratio slopes and diversity orders. Specifically, 1) for the downlink case, a sensing-centric (S-C) design and a communications-centric (C-C) design are investigated based on different beamforming strategies, and a Pareto optimal design is proposed to characterize the attainable SR-CR region; and 2) for the uplink case, the S-C design and the C-C design are distinguished by the interference cancellation order of the communication signal and the sensing signal, and the rate region is obtained through a time-sharing strategy.

We investigate some important properties of this family of distributions. The maximum likelihood estimation, L-moments estimation and two-step estimation for the SkeGTD are explored.

        "abstract": "We discuss two novel approaches to the classical two-sample problem. Our starting point are properly standardized and combined, very popular in several areas of statistics and data analysis, ordinal dominance and receiver characteristic curves, denoted by ODC and ROC, respectively. The proposed new curves are termed the comparison curves. Their estimates, being weighted rank processes on (0,1), form the basis of inference. These weighted processes are intuitive, well-suited for visual inspection of data at hand, and are also useful for constructing some formal inferential procedures. They can be applied to several variants of two-sample problem. Their use can help to improve some existing procedures both in terms of power and the ability to identify the sources of departures from the postulated model. To simplify interpretation of finite sample results we restrict attention to values of the processes on a finite grid of points. This results in the so-called bar plots (B-plots) which readably summarize the information contained in the data. What is more, we show that B-plots along with adjusted simultaneous acceptance regions provide principled information about where the model departs from the data. This leads to a framework which facilitates identification of regions with locally significant differences.\n  We show an implementation of the considered techniques to a standard stochastic dominance testing problem. Some min-type statistics are introduced and investigated. A simulation study compares two tests pertinent to the comparison curves to well-established tests in the literature and demonstrates the strong and competitive performance of the former in many typical situations. Some real data applications illustrate simplicity and practical usefulness of the proposed approaches. A range of other applications of considered weighted processes is briefly discussed too.",

        "abstract": "Climate Services (CS) provide support to decision makers across socio-economic sectors. In the agricultural sector, one of the most important CS applications is to provide timely and accurate yield forecasts based on climate prediction. In this study, the Pasture Simulation model (PaSim) was used to simulate, for the period 1959-2015, the forage production of a mown grassland system (Laqueuille, Massif Central of France) under different management conditions, with meteorological inputs extracted from the SAFRAN atmospheric database. The aim was to generate purely climate-dependent timeseries of optimal forage production, a variable that was maximized by brighter and warmer weather conditions at the grassland. A long-term increase was observed in simulated forage yield, with the 1995-2015 average being 29% higher than the 1959-1979 average. Such increase seems consistent with observed rising trends in temperature and CO2, and multi-decadal changes in incident solar radiation. At interannual timescales, sea surface temperature anomalies of the Mediterranean (MED), Tropical North Atlantic (TNA), equatorial Pacific (El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index were found robustly correlated with annual forage yield values. Relying only on climatic predictors, we developed a stepwise statistical multi-regression model with leave-one-out cross-validation. Under specific management conditions (e.g., three annual cuts) and from one to five months in advance, the generated model successfully provided a p-value<0.01 in correlation (t-test), a root mean square error percentage (%RMSE) of 14.6% and a 71.43% hit rate predicting above/below average years in terms of forage yield collection.",

Although previous works on this topic have achieved impressive success, two longstanding problems remain unsettled: 1) generating diverse and plausible facial aging patterns at the target age stage; 2) measuring the rationality of identity variation between the original portrait and its syntheses with age progression or regression. In this paper, we introduce DLAT + , the first algorithm that can realize Diverse and Lifespan Age Transformation on human faces, where the diversity jointly manifests in the transformation of facial textures and shapes. Apart from the diversity mechanism embedded in the model, multiple consistency restrictions are leveraged to keep it away from counterfactual aging syntheses. Moreover, we propose a new metric to assess the rationality of Identity Deviation under Age Gaps (IDAG) between the input face and its series of age-transformed generations, which is based on statistical laws summarized from plenty of genuine face-aging data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the uniqueness and effectiveness of our method in synthesizing diverse and perceptually reasonable faces across the whole lifetime.",

Statistical analysis and node clustering in hypergraphs constitute an emerging topic suffering from a lack of standardization. In contrast to the case of graphs, the concept of nodes' community in hypergraphs is not unique and encompasses various distinct situations. To address this, we begin by presenting, within a unified framework, the various hypergraph modularity criteria proposed in the literature, emphasizing their differences and respective focuses. Subsequently, we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art codes available to maximize hypergraph modularities for detecting node communities in binary hypergraphs. Through exploration of various simulation settings with controlled ground truth clustering, we offer a comparison of these methods using different quality measures, including true clustering recovery, running time, (local) maximization of the objective, and the number of clusters detected. Our contribution marks the first attempt to clarify the advantages and drawbacks of these newly available methods. This effort lays the foundation for a better understanding of the primary objectives of modularity-based node clustering methods for binary hypergraphs.",

However, at low bit-rates, these methods can introduce visually displeasing artifacts, such as blurring, color shifting, and texture loss, thereby compromising perceptual quality of images. To address these issues, this study presents an enhanced neural compression method designed for optimal visual fidelity. We have trained our model with a sophisticated semantic ensemble loss, integrating Charbonnier loss, perceptual loss, style loss, and a non-binary adversarial loss, to enhance the perceptual quality of image reconstructions. Additionally, we have implemented a latent refinement process to generate content-aware latent codes. These codes adhere to bit-rate constraints, balance the trade-off between distortion and fidelity, and prioritize bit allocation to regions of greater importance. Our empirical findings demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the statistical fidelity of neural image compression. On CLIC2024 validation set, our approach achieves a 62% bitrate saving compared to MS-ILLM under FID metric.",

These localization transitions occur at different critical values of Hamiltonian and dissipative disorder strength, implying the existence of atypical phases with a mixture of localized and delocalized features. We find this phenomenon is robust to changes to the value of the dissipative spectral gap.",

While statistical learning techniques like discrete choice models have been used traditionally, machine learning (ML) models have gained traction recently among the transportation planners due to their higher predictive performance. However, the black box nature of ML models pose significant interpretability challenges, limiting their practical application in decision and policy making. This study utilised a dataset of $1350$ households belonging to low and low-middle income bracket in the city of Bengaluru to investigate mode choice decision making behaviour using Multinomial logit model and ML classifiers like decision trees, random forests, extreme gradient boosting and support vector machines. In terms of accuracy, random forest model performed the best ($0.788$ on training data and $0.605$ on testing data) compared to all the other models. This research has adopted modern interpretability techniques like feature importance and individual conditional expectation plots to explain the decision making behaviour using ML models. A higher travel costs significantly reduce the predicted probability of bus usage compared to other modes (a $0.66\\%$ and $0.34\\%$ reduction using Random Forests and XGBoost model for $10\\%$ increase in travel cost). However, reducing travel time by $10\\%$ increases the preference for the metro ($0.16\\%$ in Random Forests and 0.42% in XGBoost). This research augments the ongoing research on mode choice analysis using machine learning techniques, which would help in improving the understanding of the performance of these models with real-world data in terms of both accuracy and interpretability.",

Typically, the number of atoms (columns of the dictionary) is greater than the number measurements and the sparse signal recovery problem is generally ill-posed. In this paper, we treat the signals and measurement noise as independent Gaussian random vectors with unknown signal covariance matrix and noise variance, respectively, and derive fixed point (FP) equation for solving the likelihood equation for signal powers, thereby enabling the recovery of the sparse signal support (sources with non-zero variances). Two practical algorithms, a block coordinate descent (BCD) and a cyclic coordinate descent (CCD) algorithms, that leverage on the FP characterization of the likelihood equation are then proposed. Additionally, a greedy pursuit method, analogous to popular simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), is introduced. Our numerical examples demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed covariance learning (CL) algorithms both in classic sparse signal recovery as well as in direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation problems where they perform favourably compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms under a broad variety of settings.",

These intermediate results could be shared across problems if each of them is made self-contained and easily identified. However, asymptotic analysis using Taylor expansions is limited for result borrowing because it is a step-to-step procedural approach. This article introduces EEsy, a modular system for estimating finite and infinitely dimensional parameters in related inference problems. It is based on the infinite-dimensional Z-estimation theorem, Donsker and Glivenko-Cantelli preservation theorems, and weight calibration techniques. This article identifies the systematic nature of these tools and consolidates them into one system containing several modules, which can be built, shared, and extended in a modular manner. This change to the structure of method development allows related methods to be developed in parallel and complex problems to be solved collaboratively, expediting the development of new analytical methods. This article considers four related inference problems -- estimating parameters with random sampling, two-phase sampling, auxiliary information incorporation, and model misspecification. We illustrate this modular approach by systematically developing 9 parameter estimators and 18 variance estimators for the four related inference problems regarding semi-parametric additive hazards models. Simulation studies show the obtained asymptotic results for these 27 estimators are valid. In the end, I describe how this system can simplify the use of empirical process theory, a powerful but challenging tool to be adopted by the broad community of methods developers. I discuss challenges and the extension of this system to other inference problems.",

The traditional paradigm for counterfactual reasoning in this literature is the interventional counterfactual, where hypothetical interventions are imagined and simulated. For this reason, the starting point for causal reasoning about legal protections and demographic data in AI is an imagined intervention on a legally-protected characteristic, such as ethnicity, race, gender, disability, age, etc. We ask, for example, what would have happened had your race been different? An inherent limitation of this paradigm is that some demographic interventions -- like interventions on race -- may not translate into the formalisms of interventional counterfactuals. In this work, we explore a new paradigm based instead on the backtracking counterfactual, where rather than imagine hypothetical interventions on legally-protected characteristics, we imagine alternate initial conditions while holding these characteristics fixed. We ask instead, what would explain a counterfactual outcome for you as you actually are or could be? This alternate framework allows us to address many of the same social concerns, but to do so while asking fundamentally different questions that do not rely on demographic interventions.",

        "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) presents challenges in diagnosis and treatment due to its complex and heterogeneous nature. Emerging evidence indicates that reward processing abnormalities may serve as a behavioral marker for MDD. To measure reward processing, patients perform computer-based behavioral tasks that involve making choices or responding to stimulants that are associated with different outcomes. Reinforcement learning (RL) models are fitted to extract parameters that measure various aspects of reward processing to characterize how patients make decisions in behavioral tasks. Recent findings suggest the inadequacy of characterizing reward learning solely based on a single RL model; instead, there may be a switching of decision-making processes between multiple strategies. An important scientific question is how the dynamics of learning strategies in decision-making affect the reward learning ability of individuals with MDD. Motivated by the probabilistic reward task (PRT) within the EMBARC study, we propose a novel RL-HMM framework for analyzing reward-based decision-making. Our model accommodates learning strategy switching between two distinct approaches under a hidden Markov model (HMM): subjects making decisions based on the RL model or opting for random choices. We account for continuous RL state space and allow time-varying transition probabilities in the HMM. We introduce a computationally efficient EM algorithm for parameter estimation and employ a nonparametric bootstrap for inference. We apply our approach to the EMBARC study to show that MDD patients are less engaged in RL compared to the healthy controls, and engagement is associated with brain activities in the negative affect circuitry during an emotional conflict task.",

The derived q values from q-Gaussian distribution keep approximately steady for different temporal interval scales, which indicate that there is a common scale-invariant structure in repeating FRBs.

These methods are under a common assumption that clusters can be well represented by barycenters, which may not hold in many real applications. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective framework based on spectral clustering and distribution affinity measures (e.g., maximum mean discrepancy and Wasserstein distance) for D2C. To improve the scalability, we propose to use linear optimal transport to construct affinity matrices efficiently on large datasets. We provide theoretical guarantees for the success of the proposed methods in clustering distributions.

For example, in the well-known Makridakis (M) Competitions, hybrids of traditional statistical or machine learning techniques have only recently become the top performers. With the recent architectural advances in deep learning being applied to time series forecasting (e.g., encoder-decoders with attention, transformers, and graph neural networks), deep learning has begun to show significant advantages. Still, in the area of pandemic prediction, there remain challenges for deep learning models: the time series is not long enough for effective training, unawareness of accumulated scientific knowledge, and interpretability of the model. To this end, the development of foundation models (large deep learning models with extensive pre-training) allows models to understand patterns and acquire knowledge that can be applied to new related problems before extensive training data becomes available. Furthermore, there is a vast amount of knowledge available that deep learning models can tap into, including Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models fine-tuned with scientific domain knowledge. There is ongoing research examining how to utilize or inject such knowledge into deep learning models. In this survey, several state-of-the-art modeling techniques are reviewed, and suggestions for further work are provided.",

By connecting the constant stepsize Q-learning to a time-homogeneous Markov chain, we show the distributional convergence of the iterates in Wasserstein distance and establish its exponential convergence rate. We also establish a Central Limit Theory for Q-learning iterates, demonstrating the asymptotic normality of the averaged iterates. Moreover, we provide an explicit expansion of the asymptotic bias of the averaged iterate in stepsize. Specifically, the bias is proportional to the stepsize up to higher-order terms and we provide an explicit expression for the linear coefficient. This precise characterization of the bias allows the application of Richardson-Romberg (RR) extrapolation technique to construct a new estimate that is provably closer to the optimal Q function. Numerical results corroborate our theoretical finding on the improvement of the RR extrapolation method.",

These universal statistics are predictable, even though individual flow realizations are not. Any small-scale noise vanishing slowly enough with increasing Reynolds number can trigger spontaneous stochasticity and here we show that thermal noise alone, in the absence of any larger disturbances, would suffice. If confirmed for Navier-Stokes turbulence, our findings would imply that intrinsic stochasticity of turbulent fluid motions at all scales can be triggered even by unavoidable molecular noise, with implications for modeling in engineering, climate, astrophysics and cosmology.",

Rather than fixing the number of activated experts as in the latter model, which could limit the investigation of potential experts, the former model utilizes the temperature to control the softmax weight distribution and the sparsity of the MoE during training in order to stabilize the expert specialization. Nevertheless, while there are previous attempts to theoretically comprehend the sparse MoE, a comprehensive analysis of the dense-to-sparse gating MoE has remained elusive. Therefore, we aim to explore the impacts of the dense-to-sparse gate on the maximum likelihood estimation under the Gaussian MoE in this paper. We demonstrate that due to interactions between the temperature and other model parameters via some partial differential equations, the convergence rates of parameter estimations are slower than any polynomial rates, and could be as slow as $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\log(n))$, where $n$ denotes the sample size. To address this issue, we propose using a novel activation dense-to-sparse gate, which routes the output of a linear layer to an activation function before delivering them to the softmax function. By imposing linearly independence conditions on the activation function and its derivatives, we show that the parameter estimation rates are significantly improved to polynomial rates.",

As we are yet to have real-world AV data, we model it with a non-IID (independent and identically distributed) dataset to evaluate the capabilities of the proposed system in terms of performance and privacy.

An analog known as the ergodic bipartition (EB) describes entanglement and locality and is formulated in terms of the components of eigenstates. In this paper, we significantly generalize the EB and unify it with the ETH, extending the EB to study higher correlations and systems out of equilibrium. Our main result is a diagrammatic formalism that computes arbitrary correlations between eigenstates and operators based on a recently uncovered connection between the ETH and free probability theory. We refer to the connected components of our diagrams as generalized free cumulants. We apply our formalism in several ways. First, we focus on chaotic eigenstates and establish the so-called subsystem ETH and the Page curve as consequences of our construction. We also improve known calculations for thermal reduced density matrices and comment on an inherently free probabilistic aspect of the replica approach to entanglement entropy previously noticed in a calculation for the Page curve of an evaporating black hole. Next, we turn to chaotic quantum dynamics and demonstrate the ETH as a sufficient mechanism for thermalization, in general. In particular, we show that reduced density matrices relax to their equilibrium form and that systems obey the Page curve at late times. We also demonstrate that entanglement velocities, which govern the spreading of entanglement, are encoded in higher correlations of the EB. Lastly, we examine the chaotic structure of eigenstates and operators together and reveal previously overlooked correlations between them. Crucially, these correlations encode butterfly velocities, a well-known dynamical property of interacting quantum systems.",

A common challenge is when an intervention is only effective for some proportion of the population who are not clinically identifiable. Therefore, latent group membership as well as separate survival models for groups identified need to be estimated. However, follow-up in trials may be relatively short leading to substantial censoring. We present a general Bayesian hierarchical framework that can handle this complexity by exploiting the similarity of cure fractions between end-points; accounting for the correlation between them and improving the extrapolation beyond the observed data. Assuming exchangeability between cure fractions facilitates the borrowing of information between end-points.

These restrictions are from prior information to ensure the validity of scientific theories or structural consistency based on physical phenomena. The valuable information contained in the restrictions must be considered during the estimation process to improve estimation accuracy. Many researchers have focused on linear regression models subject to linear inequality restrictions, but generalized linear models have received little attention. In this paper, the parameters of beta Bayesian regression models subjected to linear inequality restrictions are estimated. The proposed Bayesian restricted estimator, which is demonstrated by simulated studies, outperforms ordinary estimators. Even in the presence of multicollinearity, it outperforms the ridge estimator in terms of the standard deviation and the mean squared error. The results confirm that the proposed Bayesian restricted estimator makes sparsity in parameter estimating without using the regularization penalty. Finally, a real data set is analyzed by the new proposed Bayesian estimation method.",

As a result of independent interest, we demonstrate that tests specifically developed for the Pareto type I distribution substantially outperform tests for exponentiality applied to log-transformed data (since Pareto type I distributed values can be transformed to exponentiality via a simple log-transformation). Specifically, the newly proposed tests based on the multiplicative memoryless property of the Pareto distribution substantially outperform a test based on the memoryless property of the exponential distribution.

In a relatively short time, the leading pharmaceutical companies1, received an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for vaccine\\prime s en-mass deployment To monitor the potential side effect(s) of the vaccine during the (initial) vaccination campaign, we developed an optimal sequential test that allows for the early detection of potential side effect(s). This test employs a rule to stop the vaccination process once the observed number of side effect incidents exceeds a certain (pre-determined) threshold. The optimality of the proposed sequential test is justified when compared with the (\u03b1, \u03b2) optimality of the non-randomized fixed-sample Uniformly Most Powerful (UMP) test. In the case of a single side effect, we study the properties of the sequential test and derive the exact expressions of the Average Sample Number (ASN) curve of the stopping time (and its variance) via the regularized incomplete beta function. Additionally, we derive the asymptotic distribution of the relative savings in ASN as compared to maximal sample size. Moreover, we construct the post-test parameter estimate and studied its sampling properties, including its asymptotic behavior under local-type alternatives. These limiting behavior results are the consistency and asymptotic normality of the post-test parameter estimator. We conclude the paper with a small simulation study illustrating the asymptotic performance of the point and interval estimation and provide a detailed example, based on COVID-19 side effect data (see Beatty et al.

        "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks have shown to be widely applicable to a large number of fields when large amounts of labelled data are available. The recent trend has been to use models with increasingly larger sets of tunable parameters to increase model accuracy, reduce model loss, or create more adversarially robust models -- goals that are often at odds with one another. In particular, recent theoretical work raises questions about the ability for even larger models to generalize to data outside of the controlled train and test sets. As such, we examine the role of the number of hidden layers in the ResNet model, demonstrated on the MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 datasets. We test a variety of parameters including the size of the model, the floating point precision, and the noise level of both the training data and the model output. To encapsulate the model's predictive power and computational cost, we provide a method that uses induced failures to model the probability of failure as a function of time and relate that to a novel metric that allows us to quickly determine whether or not the cost of training a model outweighs the cost of attacking it. Using this approach, we are able to approximate the expected failure rate using a small number of specially crafted samples rather than increasingly larger benchmark datasets. We demonstrate the efficacy of this technique on both the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets using 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-bit floating-point numbers, various data pre-processing techniques, and several attacks on five configurations of the ResNet model. Then, using empirical measurements, we examine the various trade-offs between cost, robustness, latency, and reliability to find that larger models do not significantly aid in adversarial robustness despite costing significantly more to train.",

In this work, we study the usefulness of conformal prediction sets as an aid for human decision making by conducting a pre-registered randomized controlled trial with conformal prediction sets provided to human subjects. With statistical significance, we find that when humans are given conformal prediction sets their accuracy on tasks improves compared to fixed-size prediction sets with the same coverage guarantee. The results show that quantifying model uncertainty with conformal prediction is helpful for human-in-the-loop decision making and human-AI teams.",

Here, we use the high resolution and sensitivity of JWST to measure the host galaxy properties for 61 X-ray-selected type-I AGNs at $0.7<z<2.5$ with rest-frame optical/near-infrared imaging from COSMOS-Web and PRIMER. Black hole masses ($\\log\\left(M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\odot\\right)\\sim7.5-9.5$) are available from previous spectroscopic campaigns. We extract the host galaxy components from four NIRCam broadband images and the HST/ACS F814W image by applying a 2D image decomposition technique. We detect the host galaxy for $\\sim90\\%$ of the sample after subtracting the unresolved AGN emission. With host photometry free of AGN emission, we determine the stellar mass of the host galaxies to be $\\log\\left(M_*/M_\\odot\\right)\\sim10-11.5$ through SED fitting and measure the evolution of the mass relation between SMBHs and their host galaxies. Considering selection biases and measurement uncertainties, we find that the $M_\\mathrm{ BH}/M_*$ ratio evolves as $\\left(1+z\\right)^{0.37_{-0.60}^{+0.35}}$ thus remains essentially constant or exhibits mild evolution up to $z\\sim2.5$. We also see an amount of scatter ($\u03c3_\u03bc=0.28\\pm0.13$) is similar to the local relation and consistent with low-$z$ studies; this appears to not rule out non-causal cosmic assembly where mergers contribute to the statistical averaging towards the local relation. We highlight improvements to come with larger samples from JWST and, particularly, Euclid, which will exceed the statistical power of wide and deep surveys such as Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam.",

By considering the inclination angle as a random variable with a known probability distribution, the novel approach eliminates one major source of uncertainty in studies of the Tully-Fisher relation: inclination angle estimation from axial ratio. Leveraging the statistical strength derived from the entire sample of 28,264 \\HI-selected disk galaxies at $z < 0.06$ from the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey, I show that the restored distribution follows a sharp correlation that is approximately a power law between $-16 > M_i > -22$: $M_i = M_0 - 2.5\u03b2\\ [\\log(W_{\\rm 20}/250 {\\rm km/s})]$, with $M_0 = -19.77\\pm0.04$ and $\u03b2= 4.39\\pm0.06$. At the brighter end ($M_i < -22$), the slope of the correlation decreases to $\u03b2\\approx 3.3$, confirming previous results. Because the method accounts for measurement errors, the intrinsic dispersion of the correlation is directly measured: $\u03c3(\\log W_{20}) \\approx 0.06$\\,dex between $-17 > M_i > -23$, while $\u03c3(M_i)$ decreases from $\\sim$0.8 in slow rotators to $\\sim$0.4 in fast rotators. The statistical rectification method holds significant potential, especially in the studies of intermediate-to-high-redshift samples, where limited spatial resolution hinders precise measurements of inclination angles.",

The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has enabled the study of massive black holes (MBHs, $M_{\\rm BH}\\sim 10^{6-7} \\ \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$) up to $z\\sim 11$, thus bridging the properties of $z\\sim 6$ quasars to their ancestors. JWST spectroscopic observations of GN-z11, a well-known $z=10.6$ star forming galaxy, have been interpreted with the presence of a super-Eddington (Eddington ratio $\\equiv \\,\u03bb_{\\rm Edd}\\sim 5.5$) accreting MBH. To test this hypothesis we use a zoom-in cosmological simulation of galaxy formation and BH co-evolution. We first test the simulation results against the observed probability distribution function (PDF) of $\u03bb_{\\rm Edd}$ found in $z\\sim 6$ quasars. Then, we select in the simulation those BHs that satisfy the following criteria: (a) $10 < z < 11 $, (b) $M_{\\rm BH} > 10^6 \\ \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$. Finally we apply the Extreme Value Statistics to the PDF of $\u03bb_{\\rm Edd}$ resulting from the simulation and find that the probability of observing a $z\\sim 10-11$ MBH, accreting with $\u03bb_{\\rm Edd} \\sim 5.5$, in the volume surveyed by JWST, is very low ($<0.5\\%$). We compare our predictions with those in the literature and further discuss the main limitations of our work. Our simulation cannot explain the JWST observations of GN-z11. This might be due to (i) missing physics in simulations, or (ii) uncertainties in the data analysis.",

In this work we perform a detailed statistical analysis of the signal in order to elucidate its physical origin. Specifically, we test the standard explanation in terms of supermassive black hole mergers against the prominent alternative explanation in terms of a first-order phase transition. By means of a frequentist hypothesis test we find that the observed gravitational wave spectrum prefers a first-order phase transition at $2-3\u03c3$ significance compared to black hole mergers (depending on the underlying black hole model). This mild preference is linked to the relatively large amplitude of the observed gravitational wave signal (above the typical expectation of black hole models) and to its spectral shape (which slightly favors the phase-transition spectrum over the predominantly single power-law spectrum predicted in black hole models). The best fit to the combined PTA data set is obtained for a phase transition which dominantly produces the gravitational wave signal by bubble collisions (rather than by sound waves). The best-fit (energy-density) spectrum features, within the frequency band of the PTA experiments, a crossover from a steeply rising power law (causality tail) to a softly rising power law; the peak frequency then falls slightly above the PTA-measured range. Such a spectrum can be obtained for a strong first-order phase transition in the thick-wall regime of vacuum tunneling which reheats the Universe to a temperature of $T_*\\sim \\text{GeV}$. A dark sector phase transition at the GeV-scale provides a comparably good fit.",

In response to privacy concerns and regulatory requirements, using synthetic data has been suggested. Synthetic data is created by training a generator on real data to produce a dataset with similar statistical properties. Competing metrics with differing taxonomies for quality evaluation have been suggested, resulting in a complex landscape. Optimising quality entails balancing considerations that make the data fit for use, yet relevant dimensions are left out of existing frameworks. We performed a comprehensive literature review on the use of quality evaluation metrics on SD within the scope of tabular healthcare data and SD made using deep generative methods. Based on this and the collective team experiences, we developed a conceptual framework for quality assurance. The applicability was benchmarked against a practical case from the Dutch National Cancer Registry. We present a conceptual framework for quality assurance of SD for AI applications in healthcare that aligns diverging taxonomies, expands on common quality dimensions to include the dimensions of Fairness and Carbon footprint, and proposes stages necessary to support real-life applications. Building trust in synthetic data by increasing transparency and reducing the safety risk will accelerate the development and uptake of trustworthy AI tools for the benefit of patients. Despite the growing emphasis on algorithmic fairness and carbon footprint, these metrics were scarce in the literature review. The overwhelming focus was on statistical similarity using distance metrics while sequential logic detection was scarce. A consensus-backed framework that includes all relevant quality dimensions can provide assurance for safe and responsible real-life applications of SD.",

Hyperbolic spaces have proven to be an important tool for embedding computations and analysis tasks as their non-linear nature lends itself well to tree or graph data. Subsequently, they have also been used in the visualization of high-dimensional data, where they exhibit increased embedding performance. However, none of the existing dimensionality reduction methods for embedding into hyperbolic spaces scale well with the size of the input data. That is because the embeddings are computed via iterative optimization schemes and the computation cost of every iteration is quadratic in the size of the input. Furthermore, due to the non-linear nature of hyperbolic spaces, Euclidean acceleration structures cannot directly be translated to the hyperbolic setting. This paper introduces the first acceleration structure for hyperbolic embeddings, building upon a polar quadtree. We compare our approach with existing methods and demonstrate that it computes embeddings of similar quality in significantly less time.

The findings hold significance in shaping Chile's international perception as an investment destination, potentially influencing its standing in the global economic landscape. Demonstrating that FDI is a significant driver of economic growth could enhance confidence among foreign investors. The project's importance lies in contributing to economic knowledge and guiding strategic decisions for sustainable economic growth in Chile. Understanding the interplay of FDI and domestic investment allows for a balanced approach, promoting stable economic development and mitigating issues like excessive reliance on foreign investment. The study highlights the theory of internationalization as a conceptual framework for understanding the motives and strategies of multinational companies investing abroad. Leveraging data from sources like the Central Bank of Chile, the research analyzes variables such as Chile's economic growth (GDP), FDI, and domestic investment. The hypothesis posits a significant long-term causal relationship between FDI, National Investment (NI), and Chile's Economic Growth (GDP).

While this approach helps simplify the analysis and modeling effort, it also neglects the intrinsic multidimensional richness of ideologies. In this study, we analyze social interactions on Reddit, under the lens of a multi-dimensional ideological framework: the political compass. We examine over 8 million comments posted on the subreddits /r/PoliticalCompass and /r/PoliticalCompassMemes during 2020--2022. By leveraging their self-declarations, we disentangle the ideological dimensions of users into economic (left--right) and social (libertarian--authoritarian) axes. In addition, we characterize users by their demographic attributes (age, gender, and affluence).\n  We find significant homophily for interactions along the social axis of the political compass and demographic attributes. Compared to a null model, interactions among individuals of similar ideology surpass expectations by 6%. In contrast, we uncover a significant heterophily along the economic axis: left/right interactions exceed expectations by 10%. Furthermore, heterophilic interactions are characterized by a higher language toxicity than homophilic interactions, which hints at a conflictual discourse between every opposite ideology. Our results help reconcile apparent contradictions in recent literature, which found a superposition of homophilic and heterophilic interactions in online political discussions. By disentangling such interactions into the economic and social axes we pave the way for a deeper understanding of opinion dynamics on social media.",

        "abstract": "Non-parametric morphology statistics have been used for decades to classify galaxies into morphological types and identify mergers in an automated way. In this work, we assess how reliably we can identify galaxy post-mergers with non-parametric morphology statistics. Low-redshift (z<0.2), recent (t_post-merger < 200 Myr), and isolated (r > 100 kpc) post-merger galaxies are drawn from the IllustrisTNG100-1 cosmological simulation. Synthetic r-band images of the mergers are generated with SKIRT9 and degraded to various image qualities, adding observational effects such as sky noise and atmospheric blurring. We find that even in perfect quality imaging, the individual non-parametric morphology statistics fail to recover more than 55% of the post-mergers, and that this number decreases precipitously with worsening image qualities. The realistic distributions of galaxy properties in IllustrisTNG allow us to show that merger samples assembled using individual morphology statistics are biased towards low mass, high gas fraction, and high mass ratio. However, combining all of the morphology statistics together using either a linear discriminant analysis or random forest algorithm increases the completeness and purity of the identified merger samples and mitigates bias with various galaxy properties. For example, we show that in imaging similar to that of the 10-year depth of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), a random forest can identify 89% of mergers with a false positive rate of 17%. Finally, we conduct a detailed study of the effect of viewing angle on merger observability and find that there may be an upper limit to merger recovery due to the orientation of merger features with respect to the observer.",

Here, we introduce a robust methodology for quantifying and inferring choice homophily in a variety of social networks. Our approach employs statistical network ensembles to estimate and standardize homophily measurements. We control for group size imbalances and activity disparities by counting the number of possible network configurations with a given number of inter-group links using combinatorics. This method provides a principled measure of connection preferences and their confidence intervals. Our framework is versatile, suitable for undirected and directed networks, and applicable in scenarios involving multiple groups. To validate our inference method, we test it on synthetic networks and show that it outperforms traditional metrics. Our approach accurately captures the generative homophily used to build the networks, even when we include additional tie-formation mechanisms, such as preferential attachment and triadic closure. Results show that while triadic closure has some influence on the inference, its impact is small in homophilic networks. On the other hand, preferential attachment does not perturb the results of the inference method. We apply our method to real-world networks, demonstrating its effectiveness in unveiling underlying gender homophily. Our method aligns with traditional metrics in networks with balanced populations, but we obtain different results when the group sizes or degrees are imbalanced. This finding highlights the importance of considering structural factors when measuring choice homophily in social networks.",

However, it is empirically observed that adversarial training on over-parameterized networks often suffers from the \\textit{robust overfitting}: it can achieve almost zero adversarial training error while the robust generalization performance is not promising. In this paper, we provide a theoretical understanding of the question of whether overfitted DNNs in adversarial training can generalize from an approximation viewpoint. Specifically, our main results are summarized into three folds: i) For classification, we prove by construction the existence of infinitely many adversarial training classifiers on over-parameterized DNNs that obtain arbitrarily small adversarial training error (overfitting), whereas achieving good robust generalization error under certain conditions concerning the data quality, well separated, and perturbation level. ii) Linear over-parameterization (meaning that the number of parameters is only slightly larger than the sample size) is enough to ensure such existence if the target function is smooth enough. iii) For regression, our results demonstrate that there also exist infinitely many overfitted DNNs with linear over-parameterization in adversarial training that can achieve almost optimal rates of convergence for the standard generalization error. Overall, our analysis points out that robust overfitting can be avoided but the required model capacity will depend on the smoothness of the target function, while a robust generalization gap is inevitable. We hope our analysis will give a better understanding of the mathematical foundations of robustness in DNNs from an approximation view.",

However, replication studies are sometimes conducted although the original study is non-significant, in which case Type-I error rate control across both studies is no longer guaranteed. We propose an alternative method to assess replicability using the sum of p-values from the two studies. The approach provides a combined p-value and can be calibrated to control the overall Type-I error rate at the same level as the two-trials rule but allows for replication success even if the original study is non-significant. The unweighted version requires a less restrictive level of significance at replication if the original study is already convincing which facilitates sample size reductions of up to 10%. Downweighting the original study accounts for possible bias and requires a more stringent significance level and larger samples sizes at replication. Data from four large-scale replication projects are used to illustrate and compare the proposed method with the two-trials rule, meta-analysis and Fisher's combination method.",

The main contribution of this paper is to transfer this powerful technique to statistical mechanics by relating two models, namely random rooted spanning forests (RSF) and random spanning trees (RST), and provide applications. More precisely, our first main theorem explicitly relates models on the level of partition functions, and probability measures, in the case of finite and infinite graphs. Then, in the planar case, we also rely on the dimer model: we introduce a killed and a drifted dimer model, extending to this general framework the models introduced in [Chh12,dT20]. Using Temperley's bijection between RST and dimers, this allows us to relate RSF to dimers and thus extend partially this bijection to RSF. As immediate applications, we give a short and transparent proof of Kenyon's result stating that the spectral curve of RSF is a Harnack curve, and provide a general setting to relate discrete massive holomorphic and harmonic functions. The other important application consists in proving universality of the convergence of the near-critical loop-erased RW, RST and dimer models by extending the results of [Chh12,CW21,HSB22] from the square lattice to any isoradial graphs: we introduce a loop erased RW, RST and dimer model on isoradial discretizations of any simply connected domain and prove convergence in the massive scaling limit towards continuous objects described by a massive version of SLE2.",

In this scenario, the attacker aims to inject a backdoor into the model by manipulating training data, such that the backdoor could be activated by a particular trigger and bootstraps the model to make a target prediction at inference. Currently, most existing data poisoning-based attacks struggle to achieve success at low poisoning ratios, increasing the risk of being defended by defense methods. In this paper, we propose a novel frequency-based backdoor attack via Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD), WPD decomposes the original image signal to a spectrogram that contains frequency information with different semantic meanings. We leverage WPD to statistically analyze the frequency distribution of the dataset to infer the key frequency regions the DNNs would focus on, and the trigger information is only injected into the key frequency regions. Our method mainly includes three parts: 1) the selection of the poisoning frequency regions in spectrogram; 2) trigger generation; 3) the generation of the poisoned dataset. Our method is stealthy and precise, evidenced by the 98.12% Attack Success Rate (ASR) on CIFAR-10 with the extremely low poisoning ratio 0.004% (i.e., only 2 poisoned samples among 50,000 training samples) and can bypass most existing defense methods. Besides, we also provide visualization analyses to explain why our method works.",

Instead of focusing on the posterior distribution of model parameters, the main interest lies then in the distribution of a specific quantity of interest contingent upon these parameters. To address the associated methodological challenges, we introduce a two-stage Sequential Monte Carlo approach. In the first stage, it generates particles that approximate the posterior distribution; in the second stage, it employs subset sampling techniques to assess the probability of the rare event of interest. By considering two hydrogeological problems of increasing complexity, we showcase the efficiency and accuracy of the resulting PostRisk-SMC method for rare event probability estimation related to groundwater hazards. We compare the performance of the PostRisk-SMC method with a traditional Monte Carlo approach that relies on Markov chain Monte Carlo samples. We showcase that our estimates align with those of the traditional method, but the coefficients of variation are notably lower for the same computational budget when targeting more rare events. Furthermore, we highlight that the PostRisk-SMC method allows estimating rare event probabilities approaching one in a billion using less than one hundred thousand forward simulations. Even if the presented examples are related to groundwater hazards, the methodology is well-suited for addressing a wide range of topics in the geosciences and beyond.",

In this work, we introduce a method to perform such concept-based interventions on already-trained neural networks, which are not interpretable by design, given an annotated validation set. Furthermore, we formalise the model's intervenability as a measure of the effectiveness of concept-based interventions and leverage this definition to fine-tune black-box models. Empirically, we explore the intervenability of black-box classifiers on synthetic tabular and natural image benchmarks. We demonstrate that fine-tuning improves intervention effectiveness and often yields better-calibrated predictions. To showcase the practical utility of the proposed techniques, we apply them to deep chest X-ray classifiers and show that fine-tuned black boxes can be as intervenable and more performant than CBMs.",

As a key application, we provide weak approximation results for a general class of SDEs driven by time-changed L\u00e9vy processes. Such SDEs and their associated fractional Fokker--Planck--Kolmogorov equations are central to models of anomalous diffusion in statistical physics, and our results provide a rigorous functional characterisation of these as continuum limits of the corresponding models driven by CTRWs. In regard to strictly M1 convergent moving averages and so-called correlated CTRWs, it turns out that the convergence of stochastic integrals can fail markedly. Nevertheless, we are able to identify natural classes of integrand processes for which the convergence holds. We end by showing that these results are general enough to yield functional limit theorems, in the M1 topology, for certain stochastic delay differential equations driven by moving averages.",

We study the efficacy of the method in samples of high energy jets at collider physics experiments, including studies on the impact of discretization, permutation invariance, and ordering.

This is formulated as a hypothesis testing problem, where under the null hypothesis, these vectors are statistically independent, while under the alternative, $\\mathsf{X}$ and a randomly and uniformly permuted version of $\\mathsf{Y}$, are correlated with correlation $\u03c1$. We analyze the thresholds at which optimal testing is information-theoretically impossible and possible, as a function of $n$ and $\u03c1$. To derive our information-theoretic lower bounds, we develop a novel technique for evaluating the second moment of the likelihood ratio using an orthogonal polynomials expansion, which among other things, reveals a surprising connection to integer partition functions. We also study a multi-dimensional generalization of the above setting, where rather than two vectors we observe two databases/matrices, and furthermore allow for partial correlations between these two.",

By leveraging the MasakhaNEWS, African Stopwords Project, and MasakhaPOS datasets, our findings emphasize that text categorization effectively identifies domain-agnostic stopwords with over 80% detection success rate for most examined languages. Nevertheless, linguistic variances result in lower detection rates for certain languages. Interestingly, we find that while over 40% of stopwords are common across news categories, less than 15% are unique to a single category. Uncommon stopwords add depth to text but their classification as stopwords depends on context. Therefore combining statistical and linguistic approaches creates comprehensive stopword lists, highlighting the value of our hybrid method. This research enhances NLP for African languages and underscores the importance of text categorization in stopword extraction.",

This article focuses on modeling dependence structures in multivariate binary data, motivated by a study aiming to understand how patterns in different U.S. senators' votes are determined by similarities (or lack thereof) in their attributes, e.g., political parties and social network profiles. To address such a research question, we propose a new Ising similarity regression model which regresses pairwise interaction coefficients in the Ising model against a set of similarity measures available/constructed from covariates. Model selection approaches are further developed through regularizing the pseudo-likelihood function with an adaptive lasso penalty to enable the selection of relevant similarity measures. We establish estimation and selection consistency of the proposed estimator under a general setting where the number of similarity measures and responses tend to infinity. Simulation study demonstrates the strong finite sample performance of the proposed estimator in terms of parameter estimation and similarity selection. Applying the Ising similarity regression model to a dataset of roll call voting records of 100 U.S. senators, we are able to quantify how similarities in senators' parties, businessman occupations and social network profiles drive their voting associations.",

Additionally, we also immediately provide an updated global model to clients after they upload their local models to reduce idle time and improve training efficiency. We evaluate our approach within an AFL deployment consisting of 10 simulated clients with heterogeneous compute constraints and non-IID data. The simulation results, using the FashionMNIST dataset, demonstrate over 10% and 19% improvement in global model accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods PAPAYA and FedAsync, respectively. Our dynamic aggregation method allows reliable global model training despite limiting client resources and statistical data heterogeneity. This improves robustness and scalability for real-world FL deployments.",

A Bayesian neural network is utilized to fit the nonlinear and multi-dimensional relationships with small errors and avoid hard theoretical derivation by computing the evidence value. Besides, \\textit{n}FBST can test not only global significance but also local and instance-wise significance, which previous testing methods don't focus on. Moreover, \\textit{n}FBST is a general framework that can be extended based on the measures selected, such as Grad-\\textit{n}FBST, LRP-\\textit{n}FBST, DeepLIFT-\\textit{n}FBST, LIME-\\textit{n}FBST.

        "abstract": "With the approaching second quantum revolution, the study of quantum thermodynamics, particularly heat flow, has become even more relevant for two main reasons. First, understanding heat and other types of noise is essential for protecting quantum information and preventing decoherence. Second, the ability to manufacture and control quantum systems developed for the quantum computer allows for experimental study of quantum thermodynamics in entirely new settings.\n  In this thesis, several systems involving quantum systems in contact with baths are studied theoretically in experimentally available settings. First, two rectification or diode setups for heat currents are proposed using a dark-state mechanism. In one system, the dark-state mechanism is imperfect but very robust. In the other system, the dark-state mechanism relies on quantum entanglement and is much better but more fragile towards decoherence. Next, a quantum version of the Wheatstone bridge is built using the same entanglement-powered dark state mechanism. After having studied several boundary-driven quantum systems, the lessons learned are generalized into resonance conditions using a general linear chain of weakly interacting chains of strongly interacting spins.\n  The final two chapters focus on the ability to study statistical physics in realizable quantum systems. First, a Maxwell's demon setup is proposed. A demon-controlled qutrit is coupled to two non-Markovian baths. The information back-flow from the non-Markovian baths allows the demon to more effectively transfer heat from the cold bath to the hot bath. Second, the Mott insulator to superfluid phase transition in a lattice of transmons is examined. The ground state has a variable particle number and is prepared using adiabatic state preparation. This allows for the exploration of the entire phase diagram.",

To apply NG to quantum systems, the quantum natural gradient (QNG) was introduced and utilized for noisy intermediate-scale devices. Additionally, a mathematically equivalent approach to QNG, known as the stochastic reconfiguration method, has been implemented to enhance the performance of quantum Monte Carlo methods. It is worth noting that these methods are based on the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) metric, which is one of the monotone metrics. So far, monotonicity has been believed to be a guiding principle to construct a geometry in physics. In this paper, we propose generalized QNG by removing the condition of monotonicity. Initially, we demonstrate that monotonicity is a crucial condition for conventional QNG to be optimal. Subsequently, we provide analytical and numerical evidence showing that non-monotone QNG outperforms conventional QNG based on the SLD metric in terms of convergence speed.",

Recent results have revealed that spectral features containing carbon (e.g. CN molecular bands) carry information correlating with the ''gold-standard'' asteroseismic classifiers that distinguish red clump from red giant branch stars. However, the underlying astrophysical processes driving the correlation between these spectroscopic and asteroseismic quantities in red giants remain inadequately explored. This study aims to enhance our understanding of this ''spectro-seismic'' effect, by refining the list of key spectral features predicting red giant evolutionary state. In addition, we conduct further investigation into those key spectral features to probe the astrophysical processes driving this connection. We employ the data-driven The Cannon algorithm to analyse high-resolution ($R\\sim80,000$) Veloce spectra from the Anglo-Australian Telescope for 301 red giant stars (where asteroseismic classifications from the TESS mission are known for 123 of the stars). The results highlight molecular spectroscopic features, particularly those containing carbon (e.g. CN), as the primary indicators of the evolutionary states of red giant stars. Furthermore, by investigating CN isotopic pairs (that is, $^{12}$C$^{14}$N and $^{13}$C$^{14}$N) we find statistically significant differences in the reduced equivalent widths of such lines, suggesting that physical processes that change the surface abundances and isotopic ratios in red giant stars, such as deep mixing, are the driving forces of the ''spectro-seismic'' connection of red giants.",

The effective equation is parameterized with quantities that vary through space away from the liquid-vapor interface. Of particular importance in describing the early time dynamics is the spatially dependent friction, for which we propose a numerical scheme to evaluate from molecular simulation. Taken together with potentials of mean force computable with importance sampling methods, we illustrate how to compute the mass accommodation coefficient and residence time distribution.

Local optimization methods such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg) are the most prominent methods for FL applications. Despite their simplicity and popularity, the theoretical understanding of local optimization methods is far from clear. This dissertation aims to advance the theoretical foundation of local methods in the following three directions.\n  First, we establish sharp bounds for FedAvg, the most popular algorithm in Federated Learning. We demonstrate how FedAvg may suffer from a notion we call iterate bias, and how an additional third-order smoothness assumption may mitigate this effect and lead to better convergence rates. We explain this phenomenon from a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) perspective.\n  Second, we propose Federated Accelerated Stochastic Gradient Descent (FedAc), the first principled acceleration of FedAvg, which provably improves the convergence rate and communication efficiency. Our technique uses on a potential-based perturbed iterate analysis, a novel stability analysis of generalized accelerated SGD, and a strategic tradeoff between acceleration and stability.\n  Third, we study the Federated Composite Optimization problem, which extends the classic smooth setting by incorporating a shared non-smooth regularizer. We show that direct extensions of FedAvg may suffer from the \"curse of primal averaging,\" resulting in slow convergence. As a solution, we propose a new primal-dual algorithm, Federated Dual Averaging, which overcomes the curse of primal averaging by employing a novel inter-client dual averaging procedure.",

However, the stochastic selection of a submodel from high-dimensional data where p exceeds n has become ubiquitous. Thus, methods for identifying observations that could exert undue influence on the choice of a submodel can play an important role in this setting. To date, discussion of this topic has been limited, falling short in two domains: (i) constrained ability to detect multiple influential points, and (ii) applicability only in restrictive settings. After describing the problem, we characterize and formalize the concept of influential observations on variable selection. Then, we propose a generalized diagnostic measure, extended from an available metric accommodating different model selectors and multiple influential observations, the asymptotic distribution of which is subsequently establish large p, thus providing guidelines to ascertain influential observations. A high-dimensional clustering procedure is further incorporated into our proposed scheme to detect multiple influential points. Simulation is conducted to assess the performances of various diagnostic approaches. The proposed procedure further demonstrates its value in improving predictive power when analyzing thermal-stimulated pain based on fMRI data.",

We would like to highlight that the data samples of the target modality are irrelevant to the other modalities, which distinguishes our method from other works utilizing paired (e.g., CLIP) or interleaved data of different modalities. We propose a methodology named Multimodal Pathway - given a target modality and a transformer designed for it, we use an auxiliary transformer trained with data of another modality and construct pathways to connect components of the two models so that data of the target modality can be processed by both models. In this way, we utilize the universal sequence-to-sequence modeling abilities of transformers obtained from two modalities. As a concrete implementation, we use a modality-specific tokenizer and task-specific head as usual but utilize the transformer blocks of the auxiliary model via a proposed method named Cross-Modal Re-parameterization, which exploits the auxiliary weights without any inference costs. On the image, point cloud, video, and audio recognition tasks, we observe significant and consistent performance improvements with irrelevant data from other modalities.

Our philosophy is to deconstruct a DDM, gradually transforming it into a classical Denoising Autoencoder (DAE). This deconstructive procedure allows us to explore how various components of modern DDMs influence self-supervised representation learning. We observe that only a very few modern components are critical for learning good representations, while many others are nonessential. Our study ultimately arrives at an approach that is highly simplified and to a large extent resembles a classical DAE. We hope our study will rekindle interest in a family of classical methods within the realm of modern self-supervised learning.",

However, robots are often studied only in closed-off lab settings, and prior mobile manipulation work is restricted to pick-move-place, which is arguably just the tip of the iceberg in this area. In this paper, we introduce Open-World Mobile Manipulation System, a full-stack approach to tackle realistic articulated object operation, e.g. real-world doors, cabinets, drawers, and refrigerators in open-ended unstructured environments. The robot utilizes an adaptive learning framework to initially learns from a small set of data through behavior cloning, followed by learning from online practice on novel objects that fall outside the training distribution. We also develop a low-cost mobile manipulation hardware platform capable of safe and autonomous online adaptation in unstructured environments with a cost of around 20,000 USD. In our experiments we utilize 20 articulate objects across 4 buildings in the CMU campus. With less than an hour of online learning for each object, the system is able to increase success rate from 50% of BC pre-training to 95% using online adaptation.

However, such prior might not be directly available or estimated inaccurately in real scenarios -- e.g., outdoor 3D reconstruction from video sequences -- therefore heavily hampering performance. In this paper, we focus on multi-view depth estimation without requiring prior knowledge about the metric range of the scene by proposing RAMDepth, an efficient and purely 2D framework that reverses the depth estimation and matching steps order. Moreover, we demonstrate the capability of our framework to provide rich insights about the quality of the views used for prediction.

We decompose this decoding mechanism for masked patch reconstruction in MAE into self-attention and cross-attention. Our investigations suggest that self-attention between mask patches is not essential for learning good representations. To this end, we propose a novel pretraining framework: Cross-Attention Masked Autoencoders (CrossMAE). CrossMAE's decoder leverages only cross-attention between masked and visible tokens, with no degradation in downstream performance. This design also enables decoding only a small subset of mask tokens, boosting efficiency. Furthermore, each decoder block can now leverage different encoder features, resulting in improved representation learning. CrossMAE matches MAE in performance with 2.5 to 3.7$\\times$ less decoding compute. It also surpasses MAE on ImageNet classification and COCO instance segmentation under the same compute.

However, this strategy may fail in the presence of class imbalance since it is possible to train models with high accuracy by overfitting to the majority class. On the other hand, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) is a widely used metric to compare classification performance of different algorithms when there is a class imbalance, and various approaches focusing on the direct optimization of this metric during training have been proposed. Among them, SVM-based formulations are especially popular as this formulation allows incorporating different regularization strategies easily. In this work, we develop a prototype learning approach that relies on cutting-plane method, similar to Ranking SVM, to maximize AUC. Our algorithm learns simpler models by iteratively introducing cutting planes, thus overfitting is prevented in an unconventional way. Furthermore, it penalizes the changes in the weights at each iteration to avoid large jumps that might be observed in the test performance, thus facilitating a smooth learning process. Based on the experiments conducted on 73 binary classification datasets, our method yields the best test AUC in 25 datasets among its relevant competitors.",

Our study confronts this challenge, operating in an environment constrained by limited hardware resources and the lack of extensive datasets or pre-trained models. We introduce the novel use of Inconsistency Masks (IM) to effectively filter uncertainty in image-pseudo-label pairs, substantially elevating segmentation quality beyond traditional semi-supervised learning techniques. By integrating IM with other methods, we demonstrate remarkable binary segmentation performance on the ISIC 2018 dataset, starting with just 10% labeled data. Notably, three of our hybrid models outperform those trained on the fully labeled dataset. Our approach consistently achieves exceptional results across three additional datasets and shows further improvement when combined with other techniques. For comprehensive and robust evaluation, this paper includes an extensive analysis of prevalent semi-supervised learning strategies, all trained under identical starting conditions.

This yields a SoS optimization program and rounding scheme that attains near-optimal solutions for spherical spin glasses in the fRSB regime. In other regimes, the same results occur at the ALG value, which is a conjectured best-value attainable by any polynomial time algorithm. These SoS programs optimize over families of distributions of possible solutions, and circumvent the oft-cited impossibility of providing a low-degree SoS proof of concentration of measure by instead proving the same bounds only in expectation on solution distributions that can be produced by the chosen rounding algorithm. The new SoS hierarchy does not make any specific reference to the spherical spin glass problem, and we conjecture that it can be applied to a broad range of average-case problems to obtain value that is optimal among polynomial-time algorithms. We give evidence for this with examples of ensembles that provably fool certain local iterative algorithms but for which there is either proof or evidence that the SoS program is better. This opens the door to addressing a question posed by Barak about the possible optimality of SoS on average-case optimization problems, and by Schramm about reductions between different families of algorithms for average-case problems. In this paper, we give low-degree SoS proofs certifying key properties about HES distributions as well as the ALG threshold for spherical spin glasses.

This paper presents a novel workflow encapsulated within a prototype application, designed to leverage the synergies between advanced image segmentation and diffusion models for a comprehensive approach to urban design. Our methodology encompasses the OneFormer model for detailed image segmentation and the Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) diffusion model, implemented through ControlNet, for generating images from textual descriptions. Validation results indicated a high degree of performance by the prototype application, showcasing significant accuracy in both object detection and text-to-image generation. This was evidenced by superior Intersection over Union (IoU) and CLIP scores across iterative evaluations for various categories of urban landscape features. Preliminary testing included utilising UrbanGenAI as an educational tool enhancing the learning experience in design pedagogy, and as a participatory instrument facilitating community-driven urban planning. Early results suggested that UrbanGenAI not only advances the technical frontiers of urban landscape reconstruction but also provides significant pedagogical and participatory planning benefits. The ongoing development of UrbanGenAI aims to further validate its effectiveness across broader contexts and integrate additional features such as real-time feedback mechanisms and 3D modelling capabilities.

Such graphs are usually large and change over time, thus, requiring models and strategies that explore their evolution. We study the evolution of aggregated graphs and introduce the GraphTempo model that allows temporal and attribute aggregation not only on node level by grouping individual nodes, but on a pattern level as well, where subgraphs are grouped together. Furthermore, We propose an efficient strategy for exploring the evolution of the graph based on identifying time intervals of significant growth, shrinkage or stability.

(c) Filtering mechanism aiming to ensure the quality and faithfulness of the generated data. We showcase this methodology by generating three large-scale synthetic data, making wishes, for Long-Form Question-Answering (LFQA), summarization, and information extraction. In a human evaluation, our generated data was found to be natural and of high quality. Furthermore, we compare models trained on our data with models trained on human-written data -- ELI5 and ASQA for LFQA and CNN-DailyMail for Summarization. We show that our models are on par with or outperforming models trained on human-generated data and consistently outperforming them in faithfulness.

In this study, we investigate the lived experiences of people who have used LLM chatbots for mental health support. We build on interviews with 21 individuals from globally diverse backgrounds to analyze how users create unique support roles for their chatbots, fill in gaps in everyday care, and navigate associated cultural limitations when seeking support from chatbots.

Nevertheless, there is a scarcity of exploration into sentiment analysis specifically in the realm of noisy Bengali texts. In this paper, we introduce a dataset (NC-SentNoB) that we annotated manually to identify ten different types of noise found in a pre-existing sentiment analysis dataset comprising of around 15K noisy Bengali texts. At first, given an input noisy text, we identify the noise type, addressing this as a multi-label classification task. Then, we introduce baseline noise reduction methods to alleviate noise prior to conducting sentiment analysis. Finally, we assess the performance of fine-tuned sentiment analysis models with both noisy and noise-reduced texts to make comparisons. The experimental findings indicate that the noise reduction methods utilized are not satisfactory, highlighting the need for more suitable noise reduction methods in future research endeavors.

Previous generic NeRF methods combine multiview stereo techniques with image-based neural rendering for generalization, yielding impressive results, while suffering from three issues. First, occlusions often result in inconsistent feature matching. Then, they deliver distortions and artifacts in geometric discontinuities and locally sharp shapes due to their individual process of sampled points and rough feature aggregation. Third, their image-based representations experience severe degradations when source views are not near enough to the target view. To address challenges, we propose the first paradigm that constructs the generalizable neural field based on point-based rather than image-based rendering, which we call the Generalizable neural Point Field (GPF). Our approach explicitly models visibilities by geometric priors and augments them with neural features. We propose a novel nonuniform log sampling strategy to improve both rendering speed and reconstruction quality. Moreover, we present a learnable kernel spatially augmented with features for feature aggregations, mitigating distortions at places with drastically varying geometries. Besides, our representation can be easily manipulated. Experiments show that our model can deliver better geometries, view consistencies, and rendering quality than all counterparts and benchmarks on three datasets in both generalization and finetuning settings, preliminarily proving the potential of the new paradigm for generalizable NeRF.",

For instance, consider a bibliographic network, with nodes representing authors and conferences with properties such as gender and location respectively, and edges representing collaboration between authors and publications in conferences. A key challenge in studying temporal graphs lies in detecting interesting events in their evolution, defined as time intervals of significant stability, growth, or shrinkage. To address this challenge, we build aggregated graphs, where nodes are grouped based on the values of their properties, and seek events at the aggregated level, for example, time intervals of significant growth in the collaborations between authors of the same gender. To locate such events, we propose a novel approach based on unified evolution skylines. A unified evolution skyline assesses the significance of an event in conjunction with the duration of the interval in which the event occurs. Significance is measured by a set of counts, where each count refers to the number of graph elements that remain stable, are created, or deleted, for a specific property value. For example, for property gender, we measure the number of female-female, female-male, and male-male collaborations. Lastly, we share experimental findings that highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.",

The more recent Embodied AI literature, on the other hand, focuses on modular or end-to-end agents trained in simulators like Habitat or AI-Thor, where the emphasis is put on photo-realistic rendering and scene diversity, but high-fidelity robot motion is assigned a less privileged role. The resulting sim2real gap significantly impacts transfer of the trained models to real robotic platforms. In this work we explore end-to-end training of agents in simulation in settings which minimize the sim2real gap both, in sensing and in actuation. Our agent directly predicts (discretized) velocity commands, which are maintained through closed-loop control in the real robot. The behavior of the real robot (including the underlying low-level controller) is identified and simulated in a modified Habitat simulator. Noise models for odometry and localization further contribute in lowering the sim2real gap. We evaluate on real navigation scenarios, explore different localization and point goal calculation methods and report significant gains in performance and robustness compared to prior work.",

This \"emergent\" organization has been found in a variety of natural and artificial systems, although at present the field lacks a unified understanding of what the consequences of higher-order synergies and redundancies are for systems. Typical research treat the presence (or absence) of synergistic information as a dependent variable and report changes in the level of synergy in response to some change in the system. Here, we attempt to flip the script: rather than treating higher-order information as a dependent variable, we use evolutionary optimization to evolve boolean networks with significant higher-order redundancies, synergies, or statistical complexity. We then analyse these evolved populations of networks using established tools for characterizing discrete dynamics: the number of attractors, average transient length, and Derrida coefficient. We also assess the capacity of the systems to integrate information. We find that high-synergy systems are unstable and chaotic, but with a high capacity to integrate information. In contrast, evolved redundant systems are extremely stable, but have negligible capacity to integrate information. Finally, the complex systems that balance integration and segregation (known as Tononi-Sporns-Edelman complexity) show features of both chaosticity and stability, with a greater capacity to integrate information than the redundant systems while being more stable than the random and synergistic systems. We conclude that there may be a fundamental trade-off between the robustness of a systems dynamics and its capacity to integrate information (which inherently requires flexibility and sensitivity), and that certain kinds of complexity naturally balance this trade-off.",

Without care, these heterogeneities impede the learning process, most notably, when optimizing fairness objectives. Confirming this, under a gaussian mixture setting, we show that the optimal SVM classifier for balanced accuracy needs to be adaptive to the class attributes. This motivates us to propose CAP: An effective and general method that generates a class-specific learning strategy (e.g. hyperparameter) based on the attributes of that class. This way, optimization process better adapts to heterogeneities. CAP leads to substantial improvements over the naive approach of assigning separate hyperparameters to each class. We instantiate CAP for loss function design and post-hoc logit adjustment, with emphasis on label-imbalanced problems. We show that CAP is competitive with prior art and its flexibility unlocks clear benefits for fairness objectives beyond balanced accuracy. Finally, we evaluate CAP on problems with label noise as well as weighted test objectives to showcase how CAP can jointly adapt to different heterogeneities.",

In contrast to classical approaches that provide a point estimate based on a maximum likelihood or a maximum a posteriori criterion using (simple) priors on the precision matrix, we consider a prior on the graph and rely on annealed Langevin diffusion to generate samples from the posterior distribution. Since the Langevin sampler requires access to the score function of the underlying graph prior, we use graph neural networks to effectively estimate the score from a graph dataset (either available beforehand or generated from a known distribution). Numerical experiments demonstrate the benefits of our approach.",

        "abstract": "Fine-grained vehicle recognition (FGVR) is an essential fundamental technology for intelligent transportation systems, but very difficult because of its inherent intra-class variation. Most previous FGVR studies only focus on the intra-class variation caused by different shooting angles, positions, etc., while the intra-class variation caused by image noise has received little attention. This paper proposes a progressive multi-task anti-noise learning (PMAL) framework and a progressive multi-task distilling (PMD) framework to solve the intra-class variation problem in FGVR due to image noise. The PMAL framework achieves high recognition accuracy by treating image denoising as an additional task in image recognition and progressively forcing a model to learn noise invariance. The PMD framework transfers the knowledge of the PMAL-trained model into the original backbone network, which produces a model with about the same recognition accuracy as the PMAL-trained model, but without any additional overheads over the original backbone network. Combining the two frameworks, we obtain models that significantly exceed previous state-of-the-art methods in recognition accuracy on two widely-used, standard FGVR datasets, namely Stanford Cars, and CompCars, as well as three additional surveillance image-based vehicle-type classification datasets, namely Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)-Vehicle, Vehicle Type Image Data 2 (VTID2), and Vehicle Images Dataset for Make Model Recognition (VIDMMR), without any additional overheads over the original backbone networks.

Many existing IoT protection solutions are cloud-based, sometimes ineffective, and might share consumer data with unknown third parties. This paper investigates the potential for effective IoT threat detection locally, on a home router, using AI tools combined with classic rule-based traffic-filtering algorithms. Our results show that with a slight rise of router hardware resources caused by machine learning and traffic filtering logic, a typical home router instrumented with our solution is able to effectively detect risks and protect a typical home IoT network, equaling or outperforming existing popular solutions, without any effects on benign IoT functionality, and without relying on cloud services and third parties.",

Although cooperative perception has exceeded the detection capabilities of single-agent systems, prevalent camera-based algorithms in cooperative perception neglect valuable information derived from historical observations. This limitation becomes critical during sensor failures or communication issues as cooperative perception reverts to single-agent perception, leading to degraded performance and incomplete BEV segmentation maps. This paper introduces TempCoBEV, a temporal module designed to incorporate historical cues into current observations, thereby improving the quality and reliability of BEV map segmentations. We propose an importance-guided attention architecture to effectively integrate temporal information that prioritizes relevant properties for BEV map segmentation. TempCoBEV is an independent temporal module that seamlessly integrates into state-of-the-art camera-based cooperative perception models. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on the OPV2V dataset that TempCoBEV performs better than non-temporal models in predicting current and future BEV map segmentations, particularly in scenarios involving communication failures. We show the efficacy of TempCoBEV and its capability to integrate historical cues into the current BEV map, improving predictions under optimal communication conditions by up to 2% and under communication failures by up to 19%.

For many analysis tasks, however, it is crucial to generate richer classes of models that also show how relations between data parameters affect system behavior. Such models have shown potential to uncover critical bugs, but their learning algorithms do not scale beyond small and well curated experiments. In this paper, we present $SL^\u03bb$, an effective and scalable register automata (RA) learning algorithm that significantly reduces the number of tests required for inferring models. It achieves this by combining a tree-based cost-efficient data structure with mechanisms for computing short and restricted tests. We have implemented $SL^\u03bb$ as a new algorithm in RALib. We evaluate its performance by comparing it against $SL^*$, the current state-of-the-art RA learning algorithm, in a series of experiments, and show superior performance and substantial asymptotic improvements in bigger systems.",

We introduce a diverse people image ranking method which more flexibly aligns with human notions of people diversity in a less prescriptive, label-free manner. The Perception-Aligned Text-derived Human representation Space (PATHS) aims to capture all or many relevant features of people-related diversity, and, when used as the representation space in the standard Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) ranking algorithm, is better able to surface a range of types of people-related diversity (e.g. disability, cultural attire). PATHS is created in two stages. First, a text-guided approach is used to extract a person-diversity representation from a pre-trained image-text model. Then this representation is fine-tuned on perception judgments from human annotators so that it captures the aspects of people-related similarity that humans find most salient. Empirical results show that the PATHS method achieves diversity better than baseline methods, according to side-by-side ratings from human annotators.",

To address this limitation, we propose VALL-T, a generative Transducer model that introduces shifting relative position embeddings for input phoneme sequence, explicitly indicating the monotonic generation process while maintaining the architecture of decoder-only Transformer. Consequently, VALL-T retains the capability of prompt-based zero-shot adaptation and demonstrates better robustness against hallucinations with a relative reduction of 28.3\\% in the word error rate. Furthermore, the controllability of alignment in VALL-T during decoding facilitates the use of untranscribed speech prompts, even in unknown languages. It also enables the synthesis of lengthy speech by utilizing an aligned context window.",

However, proving the correctness of complex systems completely is difficult because they are composed of multiple components, usage scenarios, and environments. We present QuAC, a modular approach for quantifying the correctness of service-oriented software systems by combining software architecture modeling with deductive verification. Our approach is based on a model of the service-oriented architecture and the probabilistic usage scenarios of the system. The correctness of a single service is approximated by a coverage region, which is a formula describing which inputs for that service are proven to not lead to an erroneous execution. The coverage regions can be determined by a combination of various analyses, e.g., formal verification, expert estimations, or testing. The coverage regions and the software model are then combined into a probabilistic program. From this, we can compute the probability that under a given usage profile no service is called outside its coverage region. If the coverage region is large enough, then instead of attempting to get 100% coverage, which may be prohibitively expensive, run-time verification or testing approaches may be used to deal with inputs outside the coverage region. We also present an implementation of QuAC for Java using the modeling tool Palladio and the deductive verification tool KeY. We demonstrate its usability by applying it to a software simulation of an energy system.",

As a result of independent interest, we also show that any pseudo-deterministic quantum-oracle algorithm (i.e., a quantum algorithm that with high probability returns the same value on repeated executions) can be simulated by a computationally unbounded but query bounded classical-oracle algorithm with only a polynomial blowup in the number of queries. This implies as a corollary that our lifting theorem holds even for PRGs that themselves make quantum queries to the random oracle.",

Often, additional combinatorial constraints such as cardinality constraint $\\left(|B|\\leq k\\right)$ or matroid constraint ($B$ is a basis of a matroid defined on $[n]$) must be satisfied by the chosen set of vectors. The minimum eigenvalue problem with matroid constraints models a wide variety of problems including the Santa Clause problem, the E-design problem, and the constructive Kadison-Singer problem.\n  In this paper, we give a randomized algorithm that finds a set $B\\subseteq [n]$ subject to any matroid constraint whose minimum eigenvalue is at least $(1-\u03b5)$ times the optimum, with high probability. The running time of the algorithm is $O\\left( n^{O(d\\log(d)/\u03b5^2)}\\right)$. In particular, our results give a polynomial time asymptotic scheme when the dimension of the vectors is constant. Our algorithm uses a convex programming relaxation of the problem after guessing a rescaling which allows us to apply pipage rounding and matrix Chernoff inequalities to round to a good solution. The key new component is a structural lemma which enables us to \"guess'' the appropriate rescaling, which could be of independent interest. Our approach generalizes the approximation guarantee to monotone, homogeneous functions and as such we can maximize $\\det(\\sum_{i\\in B} v_i v_i^\\top)^{1/d}$, or minimize any norm of the eigenvalues of the matrix $\\left(\\sum_{i\\in B} v_i v_i^\\top\\right)^{-1} $, with the same running time under some mild assumptions.

With the continuous advancement in data-driven artificial intelligence (AI), MSF's potential for sensing and understanding intricate external environments has been further amplified, bringing a profound impact on intelligent systems and specifically on their perception systems. Similar to traditional software, adequate testing is also required for AI-enabled MSF systems. Yet, existing testing methods primarily concentrate on single-sensor perception systems (e.g., image-/point cloud-based object detection systems). There remains a lack of emphasis on generating multi-modal test cases for MSF systems. To address these limitations, we design and implement MultiTest, a fitness-guided metamorphic testing method for complex MSF perception systems. MultiTest employs a physical-aware approach to synthesize realistic multi-modal object instances and insert them into critical positions of background images and point clouds. A fitness metric is designed to guide and boost the test generation process. We conduct extensive experiments with five SOTA perception systems to evaluate MultiTest from the perspectives of: (1) generated test cases' realism, (2) fault detection capabilities, and (3) performance improvement. The results show that MultiTest can generate realistic and modality-consistent test data and effectively detect hundreds of diverse faults of an MSF system under test. Moreover, retraining an MSF system on the test cases generated by MultiTest can improve the system's robustness.",

People create and publicly share their own playlists to express their musical tastes, promote the discovery of their favorite artists, and foster social connections. These publicly accessible playlists transcend the boundaries of mere musical preferences: they serve as sources of rich insights into users' attributes and identities. For example, the musical preferences of elderly individuals may lean more towards Frank Sinatra, while Billie Eilish remains a favored choice among teenagers. These playlists thus become windows into the diverse and evolving facets of one's musical identity.\n  In this work, we investigate the relationship between Spotify users' attributes and their public playlists. In particular, we focus on identifying recurring musical characteristics associated with users' individual attributes, such as demographics, habits, or personality traits. To this end, we conducted an online survey involving 739 Spotify users, yielding a dataset of 10,286 publicly shared playlists encompassing over 200,000 unique songs and 55,000 artists. Through extensive statistical analyses, we first assess a deep connection between a user's Spotify playlists and their real-life attributes. For instance, we found individuals high in openness often create playlists featuring a diverse array of artists, while female users prefer Pop and K-pop music genres. Building upon these observed associations, we create accurate predictive models for users' attributes, presenting a novel DeepSet application that outperforms baselines in most of these users' attributes.",

        "abstract": "The field of natural language processing (NLP) has witnessed significant progress in recent years, with a notable focus on improving large language models' (LLM) performance through innovative prompting techniques. Among these, prompt engineering coupled with structures has emerged as a promising paradigm, with designs such as Chain-of-Thought, Tree of Thoughts, or Graph of Thoughts, in which the overall LLM reasoning is guided by a structure such as a graph. As illustrated with numerous examples, this paradigm significantly enhances the LLM's capability to solve numerous tasks, ranging from logical or mathematical reasoning to planning or creative writing. To facilitate the understanding of this growing field and pave the way for future developments, we devise a general blueprint for effective and efficient LLM reasoning schemes. For this, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the prompt execution pipeline, clarifying and clearly defining different concepts. We then build the first taxonomy of structure-enhanced LLM reasoning schemes. We focus on identifying fundamental classes of harnessed structures, and we analyze the representations of these structures, algorithms executed with these structures, and many others. We refer to these structures as reasoning topologies, because their representation becomes to a degree spatial, as they are contained within the LLM context. Our study compares existing prompting schemes using the proposed taxonomy, discussing how certain design choices lead to different patterns in performance and cost. We also outline theoretical underpinnings, relationships between prompting and others parts of the LLM ecosystem such as knowledge bases, and the associated research challenges. Our work will help to advance future prompt engineering techniques.",

The existing challenge lies in achieving precise tactile feature estimation, especially concerning contact geometry characteristics, using cost-effective solutions. We hypothesise that by harnessing acoustic energy through dedicated acoustic channels in 2 layers beneath the sensing surface and analysing amplitude modulation, we can effectively decode interactions on the sensory surface, thereby improving tactile feature estimation. Our approach involves the distinct separation of hardware components responsible for emitting and receiving acoustic signals, resulting in a modular and highly customizable skin design. Practical tests demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel design, achieving remarkable precision in estimating contact normal forces (MAE < 0.8 N), 2D contact localisation (MAE < 0.7 mm), and contact surface diameter (MAE < 0.3 mm). In conclusion, the AST skin, with its innovative design and modular architecture, successfully addresses the challenge of tactile feature estimation. The presented results showcase its ability to precisely estimate various tactile features, making it a practical and cost-effective solution for robotic applications.",

However, the prevalent practice of employing additional CT scans for generating attenuation maps (u-map) for PET attenuation correction significantly elevates radiation doses. To address this concern and further mitigate radiation exposure in low-dose PET exams, we propose POUR-Net - an innovative population-prior-aided over-under-representation network that aims for high-quality attenuation map generation from low-dose PET. First, POUR-Net incorporates an over-under-representation network (OUR-Net) to facilitate efficient feature extraction, encompassing both low-resolution abstracted and fine-detail features, for assisting deep generation on the full-resolution level. Second, complementing OUR-Net, a population prior generation machine (PPGM) utilizing a comprehensive CT-derived u-map dataset, provides additional prior information to aid OUR-Net generation. The integration of OUR-Net and PPGM within a cascade framework enables iterative refinement of $\u03bc$-map generation, resulting in the production of high-quality $\u03bc$-maps. Experimental results underscore the effectiveness of POUR-Net, showing it as a promising solution for accurate CT-free low-count PET attenuation correction, which also surpasses the performance of previous baseline methods.",

IL involves unintentionally exposing secret (sensitive) information to unauthorized parties via systems' observable information. Conventional statistical approaches, which estimate mutual information (MI) between observable and secret information for detecting IL, face challenges such as the curse of dimensionality, convergence, computational complexity, and MI misestimation. Furthermore, emerging supervised machine learning (ML) methods, though effective, are limited to binary system-sensitive information and lack a comprehensive theoretical framework. To address these limitations, we establish a theoretical framework using statistical learning theory and information theory to accurately quantify and detect IL. We demonstrate that MI can be accurately estimated by approximating the log-loss and accuracy of the Bayes predictor. As the Bayes predictor is typically unknown in practice, we propose to approximate it with the help of automated machine learning (AutoML). First, we compare our MI estimation approaches against current baselines, using synthetic data sets generated using the multivariate normal (MVN) distribution with known MI. Second, we introduce a cut-off technique using one-sided statistical tests to detect IL, employing the Holm-Bonferroni correction to increase confidence in detection decisions. Our study evaluates IL detection performance on real-world data sets, highlighting the effectiveness of the Bayes predictor's log-loss estimation, and finds our proposed method to effectively estimate MI on synthetic data sets and thus detect ILs accurately.",

We propose an innovative approach that utilizes the romanized form of text as an interface for LLMs, hypothesizing that its frequent informal use and shared tokens with English enhance cross-lingual alignment. Focusing on Hindi, we demonstrate through Hindi-to-English translation and sentiment analysis tasks that romanized text not only significantly improves inference efficiency due to its lower fertility compared to native text but also achieves competitive performance with limited pre-training. Additionally, our novel multi-script prompting approach, which combines romanized and native texts, shows promise in further enhancing task performance. These findings suggest the potential of romanization in bridging the language gap for LLM applications, with future work aimed at expanding this approach to more languages and tasks.",

However, code snippets on Q&A sites are usually uncompilable and semantically incomplete for compilation due to unresolved types and missing dependent libraries, which raises the obstacle for users to reuse or analyze Q&A code snippets. Prior approaches either are not designed for synthesizing compilable code or suffer from a low compilation success rate. To address this problem, we propose ZS4C, a lightweight approach to perform zero-shot synthesis of compilable code from incomplete code snippets using Large Language Model (LLM). ZS4C operates in two stages. In the first stage, ZS4C utilizes an LLM, i.e., ChatGPT, to identify missing import statements for a given code snippet, leveraging our designed task-specific prompt template. In the second stage, ZS4C fixes compilation errors caused by incorrect import statements and syntax errors through collaborative work between ChatGPT and a compiler. We thoroughly evaluated ZS4C on a widely used benchmark called StatType-SO against the SOTA approach SnR. Compared with SnR, ZS4C improves the compilation rate from 63% to 87.6%, with a 39.3% improvement. On average, ZS4C can infer more accurate import statements than SnR, with an improvement of 6.6% in the F1.",

Recent breakthroughs in research have successfully alleviated these constraints by introducing a modular architecture that decouples consensus from execution. The move toward independent optimization of the consensus layer has shifted attention to the execution layer.\n  While concurrent transaction execution is a promising solution for increasing throughput, practical challenges persist. Its effectiveness varies based on the workloads, and the associated increased hardware requirements raise concerns about undesirable centralization. This increased requirement results in full nodes and stragglers synchronizing from signed checkpoints, decreasing the trustless nature of blockchain systems.\n  In response to these challenges, this paper introduces Chiron, a system designed to extract execution hints for the acceleration of straggling and full nodes. Notably, Chiron achieves this without compromising the security of the system or introducing overhead on the critical path of consensus. Evaluation results demonstrate a notable speedup of up to 30%, effectively addressing the gap between theoretical research and practical deployment. The quantification of this speedup is achieved through realistic blockchain benchmarks derived from a comprehensive analysis of Ethereum and Solana workloads, constituting an independent contribution.",

In this paper, we propose an alternative, instance-based approach to the problem. We define the \"Levenshtein difficulty\" of a problem instance $(s,T)$ as the probability that the resulting traces do not provide enough information for correct recovery with full certainty. One can then try to characterize, for a specific $s$, how $T$ needs to scale in order for the Levenshtein difficulty to go to zero, and seek reconstruction algorithms that match this scaling for each $s$. For a class of binary strings with alternating long runs, we precisely characterize the scaling of $T$ for which the Levenshtein difficulty goes to zero. For this class, we also prove that a simple \"Las Vegas algorithm\" has an error probability that decays to zero with the same rate as that with which the Levenshtein difficulty tends to zero.",

Towards this ultimate goal, one direction is to build a single model that handles diverse audio duration, sampling frequencies, and microphone variations in noisy and reverberant scenarios, which we define here as \"input condition invariant SE\". Such a model was recently proposed showing promising performance; however, its multi-channel performance degraded severely in real conditions. In this paper we propose novel architectures to improve the input condition invariant SE model so that performance in simulated conditions remains competitive while real condition degradation is much mitigated. For this purpose, we redesign the key components that comprise such a system. First, we identify that the channel-modeling module's generalization to unseen scenarios can be sub-optimal and redesign this module. We further introduce a two-stage training strategy to enhance training efficiency. Second, we propose two novel dual-path time-frequency blocks, demonstrating superior performance with fewer parameters and computational costs compared to the existing method. All proposals combined, experiments on various public datasets validate the efficacy of the proposed model, with significantly improved performance on real conditions.

It consists of a free energy and a dissipation potential, which can be either expressed by the components of their tensor arguments or by a suitable set of invariants. The two potentials are described by fully/partially input convex neural networks. For training of the NN model by paths of stress and strain, an efficient and flexible training method based on a recurrent cell, particularly a long short-term memory cell, is developed to automatically generate the internal variable(s) during the training process. The proposed method is benchmarked and thoroughly compared with existing approaches. These include a method that obtains the internal variable by integrating the evolution equation over the entire sequence, while the other method uses an an auxiliary feedforward neural network for the internal variable(s). Databases for training are generated by using a conventional nonlinear viscoelastic reference model, where 3D and 2D plane strain data with either ideal or noisy stresses are generated. The coordinate-based and the invariant-based formulation are compared and the advantages of the latter are demonstrated. Afterwards, the invariant-based model is calibrated by applying the three training methods using ideal or noisy stress data. All methods yield good results, but differ in computation time and usability for large data sets. The presented training method based on a recurrent cell turns out to be particularly robust and widely applicable and thus represents a promising approach for the calibration of other types of models as well.",

Existing models employ simulated data and constrained experimental settings, which limit generalization to real-world SR. Predictive models are known to perform well in fixed experimental settings, but can introduce artifacts in adverse conditions. On the other hand, generative models learn the distribution of target data and have a better capacity to perform well on unseen conditions. In this study, we propose a novel two-stage approach that combines the strengths of predictive and generative models. Specifically, we employ a diffusion-based model that is conditioned on the output of a predictive model. Our experiments demonstrate that the model significantly outperforms single-stage counterparts and existing strong baselines on benchmark SR datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a repainting technique during the inference of the diffusion process, enabling the proposed model to regenerate high-frequency components even in mismatched conditions. An additional contribution is the collection of and evaluation on real SR recordings, using the same microphone at different native sampling rates. We make this dataset freely accessible, to accelerate progress towards real-world speech super-resolution.",

The crucial computational mechanism underlying their performance relies on transforming a complete input sequence - for example, all the words in a sentence into a long \"encoding vector\" - that allows transformers to learn long-range temporal dependencies in naturalistic sequences. Specifically, \"self-attention\" applied to this encoding vector enhances temporal context in transformers by computing associations between pairs of words in the input sequence. We suggest that waves of neural activity, traveling across single cortical regions or across multiple regions at the whole-brain scale, could implement a similar encoding principle. By encapsulating recent input history into a single spatial pattern at each moment in time, cortical waves may enable temporal context to be extracted from sequences of sensory inputs, the same computational principle used in transformers.",

The transmitted messages must be decoded within $n$ channel uses, while some codewords are not completely received due to asynchronicities. We consider a constraint of the largest allowed delay of the transmission. The AUMAC lacks the permutation-invariant property of the synchronous UMAC since different permutations of the same codewords with a fixed asynchronicity are distinguishable. Hence, the analyses require calculating all $2^{\\textsf{K}_a}-1$ combinations of erroneously decoded messages. Moreover, transmitters cannot adapt the corresponding codebooks according to asynchronicity due to a lack of information on asynchronicities. To overcome this challenge, a uniform bound of the per-user probability of error (PUPE) is derived by investigating the worst-case of the asynchronous patterns with the delay constraint. Numerical results show the trade-off between the energy-per-bit and the number of active users for different delay constraints. In addition, although the asynchronous transmission reduces interference, the required energy-per-bit increases as the receiver decodes with incompletely received codewords, compared to the synchronous case.",

However, the generated objects are stochastic and lack fine-grained control. Sketches provide a cheap approach to introduce such fine-grained control. Nevertheless, it is challenging to achieve flexible control from these sketches due to their abstraction and ambiguity. In this paper, we present a multi-view sketch-guided text-to-3D generation framework (namely, Sketch2NeRF) to add sketch control to 3D generation. Specifically, our method leverages pretrained 2D diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion and ControlNet) to supervise the optimization of a 3D scene represented by a neural radiance field (NeRF). We propose a novel synchronized generation and reconstruction method to effectively optimize the NeRF. In the experiments, we collected two kinds of multi-view sketch datasets to evaluate the proposed method. We demonstrate that our method can synthesize 3D consistent contents with fine-grained sketch control while being high-fidelity to text prompts. Extensive results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of sketch similarity and text alignment.",

        "abstract": "Modern plankton high-throughput monitoring relies on deep learning classifiers for species recognition in water ecosystems. Despite satisfactory nominal performances, a significant challenge arises from Dataset Shift, which causes performances to drop during deployment. In our study, we integrate the ZooLake dataset with manually-annotated images from 10 independent days of deployment, serving as test cells to benchmark Out-Of-Dataset (OOD) performances. Our analysis reveals instances where classifiers, initially performing well in In-Dataset conditions, encounter notable failures in practical scenarios. For example, a MobileNet with a 92% nominal test accuracy shows a 77% OOD accuracy. We systematically investigate conditions leading to OOD performance drops and propose a preemptive assessment method to identify potential pitfalls when classifying new data, and pinpoint features in OOD images that adversely impact classification. We present a three-step pipeline: (i) identifying OOD degradation compared to nominal test performance, (ii) conducting a diagnostic analysis of degradation causes, and (iii) providing solutions. We find that ensembles of BEiT vision transformers, with targeted augmentations addressing OOD robustness, geometric ensembling, and rotation-based test-time augmentation, constitute the most robust model, which we call BEsT model. It achieves an 83% OOD accuracy, with errors concentrated on container classes. Moreover, it exhibits lower sensitivity to dataset shift, and reproduces well the plankton abundances. Our proposed pipeline is applicable to generic plankton classifiers, contingent on the availability of suitable test cells. By identifying critical shortcomings and offering practical procedures to fortify models against dataset shift, our study contributes to the development of more reliable plankton classification technologies.",

This is a task that is often hampered by severely imbalanced datasets, where positive cases can be quite rare. Their use is further compromised by their limited interpretability, which is becoming increasingly important. While post-hoc interpretability techniques such as SHAP and LIME have been used with some success on so-called black box models, the use of inherently understandable models makes such endeavors more fruitful. This paper addresses these issues by demonstrating how a relatively new synthetic data generation technique, STEM, can be used to produce data to train models produced by Grammatical Evolution (GE) that are inherently understandable. STEM is a recently introduced combination of the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), Edited Nearest Neighbour (ENN), and Mixup; it has previously been successfully used to tackle both between class and within class imbalance issues. We test our technique on the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) and the Wisconsin Breast Cancer (WBC) datasets and compare Area Under the Curve (AUC) results with an ensemble of the top three performing classifiers from a set of eight standard ML classifiers with varying degrees of interpretability. We demonstrate that the GE-derived models present the best AUC while still maintaining interpretable solutions.",

These entities utilize instrumented profiles to disseminate divisive content and disinformation, shaping public perception. Despite ample evidence of these instrumented profiles, few identification methods exist to locate them in the wild. To evade detection and appear genuine, small clusters of instrumented profiles engage in unrelated discussions, diverting attention from their true goals. This strategic thematic diversity conceals their selective polarity towards certain topics and fosters public trust.\n  This study aims to characterize profiles potentially used for influence operations, termed 'on-mission profiles,' relying solely on thematic content diversity within unlabeled data. Distinguishing this work is its focus on content volume and toxicity towards specific themes. Longitudinal data from 138K Twitter or X, profiles and 293M tweets enables profiling based on theme diversity. High thematic diversity groups predominantly produce toxic content concerning specific themes, like politics, health, and news classifying them as 'on-mission' profiles.\n  Using the identified ``on-mission\" profiles, we design a classifier for unseen, unlabeled data. Employing a linear SVM model, we train and test it on an 80/20% split of the most diverse profiles. The classifier achieves a flawless 100% accuracy, facilitating the discovery of previously unknown ``on-mission\" profiles in the wild.",

However, the adoption and impact of contracts in the context of mobile application development, particularly of Android applications, remain unexplored.\n  To address this, we present the first large-scale empirical study on the presence and use of contracts in Android applications, written in Java or Kotlin. We consider different types of contract elements divided into five categories: conditional runtime exceptions, APIs, annotations, assertions, and other. We analyzed 2,390 Android applications from the F-Droid repository and processed more than 51,749 KLOC to determine 1) how and to what extent contracts are used, 2) how contract usage evolves, and 3) whether contracts are used safely in the context of program evolution and inheritance. Our findings include: 1) although most applications do not specify contracts, annotation-based approaches are the most popular among practitioners; 2) applications that use contracts continue to use them in later versions, but the number of methods increases at a higher rate than the number of contracts; and 3) there are many potentially unsafe specification changes when applications evolve and in subtyping relationships, which indicates a lack of specification stability. Our findings show that it would be desirable to have libraries that standardize contract specifications in Java and Kotlin, and tools that aid practitioners in writing stronger contracts and in detecting contract violations in the context of program evolution and inheritance.",

Small-scale experiments generate initial insights although the trends observed are not consistent with the entire dataset. Filtering operations in the image processing pipeline are crucial, with image filtering before pre-processing yielding better results.

        "abstract": "This study developed a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based defense method for traffic sign classification in an autonomous vehicle (AV), referred to as the attack-resilient GAN (AR-GAN). The novelty of the AR-GAN lies in (i) assuming zero knowledge of adversarial attack models and samples and (ii) providing consistently high traffic sign classification performance under various adversarial attack types. The AR-GAN classification system consists of a generator that denoises an image by reconstruction, and a classifier that classifies the reconstructed image. The authors have tested the AR-GAN under no-attack and under various adversarial attacks, such as Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), DeepFool, Carlini and Wagner (C&W), and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). The authors considered two forms of these attacks, i.e., (i) black-box attacks (assuming the attackers possess no prior knowledge of the classifier), and (ii) white-box attacks (assuming the attackers possess full knowledge of the classifier). The classification performance of the AR-GAN was compared with several benchmark adversarial defense methods. The results showed that both the AR-GAN and the benchmark defense methods are resilient against black-box attacks and could achieve similar classification performance to that of the unperturbed images. However, for all the white-box attacks considered in this study, the AR-GAN method outperformed the benchmark defense methods. In addition, the AR-GAN was able to maintain its high classification performance under varied white-box adversarial perturbation magnitudes, whereas the performance of the other defense methods dropped abruptly at increased perturbation magnitudes.",

In this paper, we investigate the inverse: porting whole functional modules that encode task-specific knowledge from one model to another. We designed a study comprising 1,440 training/testing runs to test the portability of modules trained by parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) techniques, using sentiment analysis as an example task. We test portability in a wide range of scenarios, involving different PEFT techniques and different pretrained host models, among other dimensions. We compare the performance of ported modules with that of equivalent modules trained (i) from scratch, and (ii) from parameters sampled from the same distribution as the ported module. We find that the ported modules far outperform the two alternatives tested, but that there are interesting performance differences between the four PEFT techniques. We conclude that task-specific knowledge in the form of structurally modular sets of parameters as produced by PEFT techniques is highly portable, but that degree of success depends on type of PEFT and on differences between originating and receiving pretrained models.",

Some recent approaches have proposed to specify reward functions as manually designed or learned reward structures whose integrations in the RL algorithms are claimed to significantly improve the learning efficiency. Manually designed reward structures can suffer from inaccuracy and existing automatically learning methods are often computationally intractable for complex tasks. The integration of inaccurate or partial reward structures in RL algorithms fail to learn optimal policies. In this work, we propose an RL algorithm that can automatically structure the reward function for sample efficiency, given a set of labels that signify subtasks. Given such minimal knowledge about the task, we train a high-level policy that selects optimal sub-tasks in each state together with a low-level policy that efficiently learns to complete each sub-task. We evaluate our algorithm in a variety of sparse-reward environments. The experiment results show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-art baselines as the difficulty of the task increases.",

InfiniteEn incorporates an efficient energy combiner to combine energy from different harvesting sources. The energy combiner uses capacitor-to-capacitor energy transfer to combine energy from multiple sources and achieves a nominal efficiency of 88\\%. In addition to multiplexing different sources, the energy combiner facilitates the estimation of the harvesting rate and the calibration of the capacity of the energy buffer. The energy storage architecture of InfiniteEn employs an array of storage buffers that can be configured on demand to cope with varying energy harvesting rates and load's energy requirements. To address the challenge of tracking the energy state of batteryless devices with minimum energy overhead, this work introduces the concept of a Load Monitoring Module (LMM). InfiniteEn is a load-agnostic platform, meaning that it does not require any prior knowledge of the energy profile of the load to track its energy states. The LMM assists InfiniteEn in tracking the energy state of the load and dynamically modifying the storage buffers to meet the load's energy requirements. Furthermore, the module can detect and signal any abnormalities in the energy consumption pattern of the load caused by a hardware or software defect. Experiments demonstrate that LMM has a response time of less than 11 ms to energy state changes.",

This task of layout prediction is valuable in text-to-image synthesis as it allows localized and controlled in-painting of the image. In this comparative study it is shown that we can predict layouts from language representations that implicitly or explicitly encode sentence syntax, if the sentences mention similar entity-relationships to the ones seen during training. To test compositional understanding, we collect a test set of grammatically correct sentences and layouts describing compositions of entities and relations that unlikely have been seen during training. Performance on this test set substantially drops, showing that current models rely on correlations in the training data and have difficulties in understanding the structure of the input sentences. We propose a novel structural loss function that better enforces the syntactic structure of the input sentence and show large performance gains in the task of 2D spatial layout prediction conditioned on text. The loss has the potential to be used in other generation tasks where a tree-like structure underlies the conditioning modality.

To address this challenge, model compression techniques, such as sparsification and weight clustering are applied, which often require modifying the underlying model aggregation schemes or involve cumbersome hyperparameter tuning, with the latter not only adjusts the model's compression rate but also limits model's potential for continuous improvement over growing data. In this paper, we propose FedCompress, a novel approach that combines dynamic weight clustering and server-side knowledge distillation to reduce communication costs while learning highly generalizable models. Through a comprehensive evaluation on diverse public datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach compared to baselines in terms of communication costs and inference speed.

Only the first two elements are usually considered and estimated when working over vast areas. Even then, separate models constitute the standard, with frequency being rarely investigated. Frequency and intensity are intertwined and depend on each other because larger events occur less frequently and vice versa. However, due to the lack of multi-temporal inventories and joint statistical models, modelling such properties via a unified hazard model has always been challenging and has yet to be attempted. Here, we develop a unified model to estimate landslide hazard at the slope unit level to address such gaps. We employed deep learning, combined with a model motivated by extreme-value theory to analyse an inventory of 30 years of observed rainfall-triggered landslides in Nepal and assess landslide hazard for multiple return periods. We also use our model to further explore landslide hazard for the same return periods under different climate change scenarios up to the end of the century. Our results show that the proposed model performs excellently and can be used to model landslide hazard in a unified manner. Geomorphologically, we find that under both climate change scenarios (SSP245 and SSP885), landslide hazard is likely to increase up to two times on average in the lower Himalayan regions while remaining the same in the middle Himalayan region whilst decreasing slightly in the upper Himalayan region areas.",

Our results reveal the presence of channel hardening in A2G communication under low UAV speeds, where we derive the maximum target spectral efficiency (SE) for a system to maintain a consistent required outage level.

In this paper, we represent items in natural language and formulate CRS as a natural language processing task. Accordingly, we leverage the power of pre-trained language models to encode items, understand user intent via conversation, perform item recommendation through semantic matching, and generate dialogues. As a unified model, our PECRS (Parameter-Efficient CRS), can be optimized in a single stage, without relying on non-textual metadata such as a knowledge graph. Experiments on two benchmark CRS datasets, ReDial and INSPIRED, demonstrate the effectiveness of PECRS on recommendation and conversation.

        "abstract": "Early detection of melanoma, a potentially lethal type of skin cancer with high prevalence worldwide, improves patient prognosis. In retrospective studies, artificial intelligence (AI) has proven to be helpful for enhancing melanoma detection. However, there are few prospective studies confirming these promising results. Existing studies are limited by low sample sizes, too homogenous datasets, or lack of inclusion of rare melanoma subtypes, preventing a fair and thorough evaluation of AI and its generalizability, a crucial aspect for its application in the clinical setting. Therefore, we assessed 'All Data are Ext' (ADAE), an established open-source ensemble algorithm for detecting melanomas, by comparing its diagnostic accuracy to that of dermatologists on a prospectively collected, external, heterogeneous test set comprising eight distinct hospitals, four different camera setups, rare melanoma subtypes, and special anatomical sites. We advanced the algorithm with real test-time augmentation (R-TTA, i.e. providing real photographs of lesions taken from multiple angles and averaging the predictions), and evaluated its generalization capabilities. Overall, the AI showed higher balanced accuracy than dermatologists (0.798, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.779-0.814 vs. 0.781, 95% CI 0.760-0.802; p<0.001), obtaining a higher sensitivity (0.921, 95% CI 0.900- 0.942 vs. 0.734, 95% CI 0.701-0.770; p<0.001) at the cost of a lower specificity (0.673, 95% CI 0.641-0.702 vs. 0.828, 95% CI 0.804-0.852; p<0.001). As the algorithm exhibited a significant performance advantage on our heterogeneous dataset exclusively comprising melanoma-suspicious lesions, AI may offer the potential to support dermatologists particularly in diagnosing challenging cases.",

The disparity between sequential text and complex spatial-temporal data hinders this application. To address this issue, this paper introduces STG-LLM, an innovative approach empowering LLMs for spatial-temporal forecasting. We tackle the data mismatch by proposing: 1) STG-Tokenizer: This spatial-temporal graph tokenizer transforms intricate graph data into concise tokens capturing both spatial and temporal relationships; 2) STG-Adapter: This minimalistic adapter, consisting of linear encoding and decoding layers, bridges the gap between tokenized data and LLM comprehension. By fine-tuning only a small set of parameters, it can effectively grasp the semantics of tokens generated by STG-Tokenizer, while preserving the original natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs. Extensive experiments on diverse spatial-temporal benchmark datasets show that STG-LLM successfully unlocks LLM potential for spatial-temporal forecasting. Remarkably, our approach achieves competitive performance on par with dedicated SOTA methods.",

Designing a lightweight audio-visual speech separation network is important for low-latency applications, but existing methods often require higher computational costs and more parameters to achieve better separation performance. In this paper, we present an audio-visual speech separation model called Top-Down-Fusion Net (TDFNet), a state-of-the-art (SOTA) model for audio-visual speech separation, which builds upon the architecture of TDANet, an audio-only speech separation method. TDANet serves as the architectural foundation for the auditory and visual networks within TDFNet, offering an efficient model with fewer parameters. On the LRS2-2Mix dataset, TDFNet achieves a performance increase of up to 10\\% across all performance metrics compared with the previous SOTA method CTCNet. Remarkably, these results are achieved using fewer parameters and only 28\\% of the multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) of CTCNet. In essence, our method presents a highly effective and efficient solution to the challenges of speech separation within the audio-visual domain, making significant strides in harnessing visual information optimally.",

Inspired by the concept of adversarial attacks, our method leverages the idea of introducing slight perturbations to the neural network input, resulting in a substantial impact on the network's performance. By introducing small perturbations to fixed-point modulated codewords before transmission, we effectively improve the decoder's performance without violating the input power constraint. The perturbation design is accomplished by a modified iterative fast gradient method. This study investigates various decoder architectures suitable for computing gradients to obtain the desired perturbations. Specifically, we consider belief propagation (BP) for LDPC codes; the error correcting code transformer, BP and neural BP (NBP) for polar codes, and neural BCJR for convolutional codes. We demonstrate that the proposed friendly attack method can improve the reliability across different channels, modulations, codes, and decoders. This method allows us to increase the reliability of communication with a legacy receiver by simply modifying the transmitted codeword appropriately.",

Autonomous supply chains (ASCs) have emerged as a potential solution, offering increased visibility, flexibility, and resilience in turbulent trade environments. Despite discussions in industry and academia over several years, ASCs lack well-established theoretical foundations. This paper addresses this research gap by presenting a formal definition of ASC along with its defining characteristics and auxiliary concepts. We propose a layered conceptual framework called the MIISI model. An illustrative case study focusing on the meat supply chain demonstrates an initial ASC implementation based on this conceptual model. Additionally, we introduce a seven-level supply chain autonomy reference model, delineating a trajectory towards achieving a full supply chain autonomy. Recognising that this work represents an initial endeavour, we emphasise the need for continued exploration in this emerging domain. We anticipate that this work will stimulate further research, both theoretical and technical, and contribute to the continual evolution of ASCs.",

However, limited attention has been given to understanding code smells in Copilot-generated Python code and Copilot's ability to fix the code smells it generates. To this end, we built a dataset comprising 102 code smells in Copilot-generated Python code. Our aim is to first explore the occurrence of code smells in Copilot-generated Python code and then evaluate the effectiveness of Copilot in fixing these code smells employing different prompts. The results show that 8 out of 10 types of Python smells can be detected in Copilot-generated Python code, among which Multiply-Nested Container is the most common one. For these code smells, Copilot Chat achieves a highest fixing rate of 87.1%, showing promise in fixing Python code smells generated by Copilot itself. Besides, the effectiveness of Copilot Chat in fixing these smells can be improved with the provision of more detailed prompts. However, using Copilot Chat to fix these smells might introduce new code smells.",

We show that all three problems can be solved in polynomial time on primitive task networks of constant partial order width (and a generalization thereof), whereas for the latter two problems this holds only under a provably necessary restriction to the state space. Next, we obtain an algorithmic meta-theorem along with corresponding lower bounds to identify tight conditions under which general polynomial-time solvability results can be lifted from primitive to general task networks. Finally, we enrich our investigation by analyzing the parameterized complexity of the three considered problems, and show that (1) fixed-parameter tractability for all three problems can be achieved by replacing the partial order width with the vertex cover number of the network as the parameter, and (2) other classical graph-theoretic parameters of the network (including treewidth, treedepth, and the aforementioned partial order width) do not yield fixed-parameter tractability for any of the three problems.",

As AI models scale, the requirement for high-bandwidth and low-latency networking compounds. The common use of electrical packet switching faces limitations due to its optical-electrical-optical conversion bottleneck. Optical switches, while bandwidth-agnostic and low-latency, suffer from having only unicast or non-scalable multicasting capability. This paper introduces an optical switching technique addressing the scalable multicasting challenge. Our approach enables arbitrarily programmable simultaneous unicast and multicast connectivity, eliminating the need for optical splitters that hinder scalability due to optical power loss. We use phase modulation in multiple planes, tailored to implement any multicast connectivity map. Using phase modulation enables wavelength selectivity on top of spatial selectivity, resulting in an optical switch that implements space-wavelength routing. We conducted simulations and experiments to validate our approach. Our results affirm the concept's feasibility and effectiveness, as a multicasting switch.",

Hypoxia, a condition characterized by low oxygen levels, is a common feature of malignant brain tumors associated with poor prognosis. Fluoromisonidazole Positron Emission Tomography (FMISO PET) is a well-established method for detecting hypoxia in vivo, but it is expensive and not widely available. Our study proposes the use of MRI, a more accessible and cost-effective imaging modality, to predict FMISO PET signals. We investigate deep learning models (DL) trained on the ACRIN 6684 dataset, a resource that contains paired MRI and FMISO PET images from patients with brain tumors. Our trained models effectively learn the complex relationships between the MRI features and the corresponding FMISO PET signals, thereby enabling the prediction of hypoxia from MRI scans alone. The results show a strong correlation between the predicted and actual FMISO PET signals, with an overall PSNR score above 29.6 and a SSIM score greater than 0.94, confirming MRI as a promising option for hypoxia prediction in brain tumors. This approach could significantly improve the accessibility of hypoxia detection in clinical settings, with the potential for more timely and targeted treatments.",

This yields a SoS optimization program and rounding scheme that attains near-optimal solutions for spherical spin glasses in the fRSB regime. In other regimes, the same results occur at the ALG value, which is a conjectured best-value attainable by any polynomial time algorithm. These SoS programs optimize over families of distributions of possible solutions, and circumvent the oft-cited impossibility of providing a low-degree SoS proof of concentration of measure by instead proving the same bounds only in expectation on solution distributions that can be produced by the chosen rounding algorithm. The new SoS hierarchy does not make any specific reference to the spherical spin glass problem, and we conjecture that it can be applied to a broad range of average-case problems to obtain value that is optimal among polynomial-time algorithms. We give evidence for this with examples of ensembles that provably fool certain local iterative algorithms but for which there is either proof or evidence that the SoS program is better. This opens the door to addressing a question posed by Barak about the possible optimality of SoS on average-case optimization problems, and by Schramm about reductions between different families of algorithms for average-case problems. In this paper, we give low-degree SoS proofs certifying key properties about HES distributions as well as the ALG threshold for spherical spin glasses. The rounding algorithm is introduced and analyzed in a companion paper.",

These cohomology rings carry two actions of the symmetric group $S_n$ whose graded characters are both of general interest in algebraic combinatorics. In this paper, we generalize the graded $S_n$-representations from the cohomologies of the above varieties to splines on Cayley graphs of $S_n$, then (1) give explicit module and ring generators for whenever the $S_n$-generating set is minimal, (2) give a combinatorial characterization of when graded pieces of one $S_n$-representation is trivial, and (3) compute the first degree piece of both graded characters for all generating sets.",

Our construction is based on a simplified conformal method, a reduction to transverse traceless perturbations and a nonlinear fixed point argument where we face linear obstructions coming from the cokernels of both the linearized constraint operator and the Laplace operator. To tackle these obstructions, we introduce a well-chosen truncated black hole around which to perturb.

This \"emergent\" organization has been found in a variety of natural and artificial systems, although at present the field lacks a unified understanding of what the consequences of higher-order synergies and redundancies are for systems. Typical research treat the presence (or absence) of synergistic information as a dependent variable and report changes in the level of synergy in response to some change in the system. Here, we attempt to flip the script: rather than treating higher-order information as a dependent variable, we use evolutionary optimization to evolve boolean networks with significant higher-order redundancies, synergies, or statistical complexity. We then analyse these evolved populations of networks using established tools for characterizing discrete dynamics: the number of attractors, average transient length, and Derrida coefficient. We also assess the capacity of the systems to integrate information. We find that high-synergy systems are unstable and chaotic, but with a high capacity to integrate information. In contrast, evolved redundant systems are extremely stable, but have negligible capacity to integrate information. Finally, the complex systems that balance integration and segregation (known as Tononi-Sporns-Edelman complexity) show features of both chaosticity and stability, with a greater capacity to integrate information than the redundant systems while being more stable than the random and synergistic systems. We conclude that there may be a fundamental trade-off between the robustness of a systems dynamics and its capacity to integrate information (which inherently requires flexibility and sensitivity), and that certain kinds of complexity naturally balance this trade-off.",

In this condition, the transmembrane potential dynamics are characterized by rapid and sharp wavefronts traveling along the heterogeneous and anisotropic conduction pathways of the brain. This work employs the monodomain model, coupled with specific neuronal ionic models characterizing ion concentration dynamics, to mathematically describe brain tissue electrophysiology in grey and white matter at the organ scale. This multiscale model is discretized in space with the high-order discontinuous Galerkin method on polygonal and polyhedral grids (PolyDG) and advanced in time with a Crank-Nicolson scheme. This ensures, on the one hand, efficient and accurate simulations of the high-frequency electrical activity that is responsible for epileptic seizure and, on the other hand, keeps reasonably low the computational costs by a suitable combination of high-order approximations and agglomerated polytopal meshes. We numerically investigate synthetic test cases on a two-dimensional heterogeneous squared domain discretized with a polygonal grid, and on a two-dimensional brainstem in a sagittal plane with an agglomerated polygonal grid that takes full advantage of the flexibility of the PolyDG approximation of the semidiscrete formulation. Finally, we provide a theoretical analysis of stability and an a-priori convergence analysis for a simplified mathematical problem.",

It can be computed using a cofibrant resolution of the algebra in a model category structure where weak equivalences are quasi-isomorphisms. This construction works for algebras over an operad, providing a cohomology theory tailored for each type of algebra. For curved algebras however, the notion of quasi-isomorphism is meaningless. The occurrence and importance of curved structures in various research topics (symplectic topology, deformation theory, derived geometry, mathematical physics) motivate the development of their homotopy theory and Andr\u00e9-Quillen cohomology theory. To get a homotopical context with an appropriate notion of weak equivalence, we consider filtered complete modules with a predifferential inducing a differential on the associated graded. Curved algebras in such modules are algebras over a curved operad. In this article, we consider curved operads which are not necessarily augmented. Bar and cobar constructions adapted to these curved operads are developed, as well as Koszul duality theory. Consequently, we obtain homotopy versions of our curved algebras and make it explicit for interesting cases. Two main examples are the curved operads encoding curved unital associative algebras and curved complex Lie algebras. In particular, homotopy curved unital associative algebras describe the structure of Floer complexes of lagrangian submanifolds and Fukaya categories in symplectic topology. Bar and cobar constructions for curved algebras are also developed, and we obtain resolutions from which we compute their Andr\u00e9-Quillen cohomology with module coefficients. Our computations in the case of curved complex Lie algebras reveal an interesting link between their Andr\u00e9-Quillen cohomology and derived complex analytic geometry.",

Supplying these finite groups with their normalised counting measures, we get an inverse family of Haar measure spaces for each $\\mathrm{SO}(d)_p$. Finally, we constructively prove the existence of the so-called inverse limit measure of these inverse families, which is explicitly computable, and prove that it gives the Haar measure on $\\mathrm{SO}(d)_p$.

The instantaneous carrier frequency is adjusted according to a periodic function synchronized with the fundamental term of the modulating signal, in order to maintain the average value of the instantaneous frequency as an odd positive integer multiple of 3, for each period of the modulating signal which is known as the average modulation order. The advantages of using the proposed technique over the conventional PWM techniques are the reduction in the total harmonic distortion and shift the frequency up of the temporal harmonics for any average modulation order. The experimental results show the viability of optimizing the time harmonics generated to minimize the vibrations in an induction motor or avoid the resonant frequencies.The mathematical formulation for the output modulated voltage is defined and the results are also checked experimentally and compared to a sinusoidal PWM technique",

        "abstract": "The field of natural language processing (NLP) has witnessed significant progress in recent years, with a notable focus on improving large language models' (LLM) performance through innovative prompting techniques. Among these, prompt engineering coupled with structures has emerged as a promising paradigm, with designs such as Chain-of-Thought, Tree of Thoughts, or Graph of Thoughts, in which the overall LLM reasoning is guided by a structure such as a graph. As illustrated with numerous examples, this paradigm significantly enhances the LLM's capability to solve numerous tasks, ranging from logical or mathematical reasoning to planning or creative writing. To facilitate the understanding of this growing field and pave the way for future developments, we devise a general blueprint for effective and efficient LLM reasoning schemes. For this, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the prompt execution pipeline, clarifying and clearly defining different concepts. We then build the first taxonomy of structure-enhanced LLM reasoning schemes. We focus on identifying fundamental classes of harnessed structures, and we analyze the representations of these structures, algorithms executed with these structures, and many others. We refer to these structures as reasoning topologies, because their representation becomes to a degree spatial, as they are contained within the LLM context. Our study compares existing prompting schemes using the proposed taxonomy, discussing how certain design choices lead to different patterns in performance and cost. We also outline theoretical underpinnings, relationships between prompting and others parts of the LLM ecosystem such as knowledge bases, and the associated research challenges. Our work will help to advance future prompt engineering techniques.",

These structures facilitate seamless transitions between distinct states of shape and find broad applicability ranging from robotics and solar cells to meta-materials and architecture. In this contribution, we study a class of mechanisms known as Kokotsakis polyhedra with a quadrangular base. These are $3\\times3$ quadrilateral meshes whose faces are rigid bodies and joined by hinges at the common edges. Compared to prior work, the quadrilateral faces do not have to be planar. In general, such meshes are not flexible, and the problem of finding and classifying the flexible ones is old, but until now largely unsolved. It appears that the tangent values of the dihedral angles between different faces are algebraically related through polynomials. Specifically, by fixing one angle as a parameter, the others can be parameterized algebraically and hence belong to an extended rational function field of the parameter. We use this approach to characterize shape restrictions resulting in flexible polyhedra.",

Results show that the proposed mathematical model can generate micro-Doppler data very similar to those from measurement data.",

In this paper, we propose an alternative, instance-based approach to the problem. We define the \"Levenshtein difficulty\" of a problem instance $(s,T)$ as the probability that the resulting traces do not provide enough information for correct recovery with full certainty. One can then try to characterize, for a specific $s$, how $T$ needs to scale in order for the Levenshtein difficulty to go to zero, and seek reconstruction algorithms that match this scaling for each $s$. For a class of binary strings with alternating long runs, we precisely characterize the scaling of $T$ for which the Levenshtein difficulty goes to zero. For this class, we also prove that a simple \"Las Vegas algorithm\" has an error probability that decays to zero with the same rate as that with which the Levenshtein difficulty tends to zero.",

The proofs employ bifurcation techniques, where the most challenging steps are related to the regularity study of some nonlinear functionals and the spectral analysis of their linearized operators around Rankine type vortices. The main difficulties stem from the roughness and the implicit form of the Green function connecting the fluid vorticity and its stream function. We handle in part these issues by exploring the asymptotic structure of the solutions to the associated elliptic problem. As to the distribution of the spectrum, it is tackled by a fixed-point argument through a perturbative approach.",

In practical applications however, the searched-for 3D distribution of the magnetic nanoparticles might show a dynamic behavior, caused by e.g. breathing or movement of the blood. Neglecting those dynamics during the reconstruction step results in motion artifacts and a reduced image quality.\n  This article addresses the challenge of capturing high quality images in the presence of motion. A promising technique provides the Regularized Sequential Subspace Optimization (RESESOP) algorithm, which takes dynamics as model inexactness into account, significantly improving reconstruction compared to standard static algorithms like regularized Kaczmarz. Notably, this algorithm operates with minimal prior information and the method allows for subframe reconstruction, making it suitable for scenarios with rapid particle movement. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on both simulated and real data sets.",

Autonomous supply chains (ASCs) have emerged as a potential solution, offering increased visibility, flexibility, and resilience in turbulent trade environments. Despite discussions in industry and academia over several years, ASCs lack well-established theoretical foundations. This paper addresses this research gap by presenting a formal definition of ASC along with its defining characteristics and auxiliary concepts. We propose a layered conceptual framework called the MIISI model. An illustrative case study focusing on the meat supply chain demonstrates an initial ASC implementation based on this conceptual model. Additionally, we introduce a seven-level supply chain autonomy reference model, delineating a trajectory towards achieving a full supply chain autonomy. Recognising that this work represents an initial endeavour, we emphasise the need for continued exploration in this emerging domain. We anticipate that this work will stimulate further research, both theoretical and technical, and contribute to the continual evolution of ASCs.",

First, we propose a semantic communication model and define the synonymous mapping to indicate the critical relationship between semantic information and syntactic information. Based on this core concept, we introduce the measures of semantic information, such as semantic entropy $H_s(\\tilde{U})$, up/down semantic mutual information $I^s(\\tilde{X};\\tilde{Y})$ $(I_s(\\tilde{X};\\tilde{Y}))$, semantic capacity $C_s=\\max_{p(x)}I^s(\\tilde{X};\\tilde{Y})$, and semantic rate-distortion function $R_s(D)=\\min_{p(\\hat{x}|x):\\mathbb{E}d_s(\\tilde{x},\\hat{\\tilde{x}})\\leq D}I_s(\\tilde{X};\\hat{\\tilde{X}})$. Furthermore, we prove three coding theorems of SIT, that is, the semantic source coding theorem, semantic channel coding theorem, and semantic rate-distortion coding theorem. We find that the limits of information theory are extended by using synonymous mapping, that is, $H_s(\\tilde{U})\\leq H(U)$, $C_s\\geq C$ and $R_s(D)\\leq R(D)$. All these works composite the basis of semantic information theory. In summary, the theoretic framework proposed in this paper is a natural extension of classic information theory and may reveal great performance potential for future communication.",

However, disturbances such as measurement noise and model mismatches occur in any real-world setting. Therefore, providing tuning methods with specific robustness guarantees would greatly benefit the practical application. To address these issues, we recast the error dynamics of a continuous-time version of the widely used consensus + innovations-based distributed parameter estimator to reflect the error dynamics induced by the classical gradient descent algorithm. This paves the way for the construction of a strong Lyapunov function. Based on this result, we derive linear matrix inequality-based tools for tuning the algorithm gains such that a guaranteed upper bound on the L2-gain with respect to parameter variations, measurement noise, and disturbances in the communication channels is achieved. An application example illustrates the efficiency of the method.",

Many experimental studies have empirically investigated how the transfer of information to neighbouring bees propagates in various shimmering processes by measuring shimmering wave strength. However, there is no analytical modelling of the collective defence mechanism in nature. Here we introduce the first analytical tri-state Inactive-Active-Relapse (IAR) model to formulate the intrinsic process of bee shimmering. The major shimmering behaviour is shown to emerge under theoretical conditions which is demonstrated numerically and visually by simulating 1,000,000 bee agents, while the number of agents is scalable. Furthermore, we elaborate on these mathematical results to construct a wave strength function to demonstrate the accuracy of shimmering dynamics. The constructed wave strength function can be adapted to peak between 50-150ms which supports the experimental studies. Our results provide a foundation for further theoretical understanding of bee shimmering wave dynamics and could serve as inspiration for modelling other self-organised phenomena across scientific applications.",

Consequently, this establishes suitable coefficient objects for constructing appropriate (co)homology theories. We develop an extension theory of modules over symmetric quandles and propose a generalized (co)homology theory for symmetric quandles with coefficients in a homogeneous Beck module, which also recovers the symmetric quandle (co)homology developed by Kamada and Oshiro [Trans.

We also propose a novel formulation of the equivariant NODEs in terms of the differential invariants of the action of $G$ on $M$, based on Lie theory for symmetries of differential equations, which provides an efficient parameterisation of the space of equivariant vector fields in a way that is agnostic to both the manifold $M$ and the symmetry group $G$. Second, we construct augmented manifold NODEs, through embeddings into equivariant flows, and show that they are universal approximators of equivariant diffeomorphisms on any path-connected $M$. Furthermore, we show that the augmented NODEs can be incorporated in the geometric framework and parameterised using higher order differential invariants. Finally, we consider the induced action of $G$ on different fields on $M$ and show how it can be used to generalise previous work, on, e.g., continuous normalizing flows, to equivariant models in any geometry.",

        "abstract": "We discuss two novel approaches to the classical two-sample problem. Our starting point are properly standardized and combined, very popular in several areas of statistics and data analysis, ordinal dominance and receiver characteristic curves, denoted by ODC and ROC, respectively. The proposed new curves are termed the comparison curves. Their estimates, being weighted rank processes on (0,1), form the basis of inference. These weighted processes are intuitive, well-suited for visual inspection of data at hand, and are also useful for constructing some formal inferential procedures. They can be applied to several variants of two-sample problem. Their use can help to improve some existing procedures both in terms of power and the ability to identify the sources of departures from the postulated model. To simplify interpretation of finite sample results we restrict attention to values of the processes on a finite grid of points. This results in the so-called bar plots (B-plots) which readably summarize the information contained in the data. What is more, we show that B-plots along with adjusted simultaneous acceptance regions provide principled information about where the model departs from the data. This leads to a framework which facilitates identification of regions with locally significant differences.\n  We show an implementation of the considered techniques to a standard stochastic dominance testing problem. Some min-type statistics are introduced and investigated. A simulation study compares two tests pertinent to the comparison curves to well-established tests in the literature and demonstrates the strong and competitive performance of the former in many typical situations. Some real data applications illustrate simplicity and practical usefulness of the proposed approaches. A range of other applications of considered weighted processes is briefly discussed too.",

These decisions are often explainable only post hoc, where counterfactual explanations are popular. The question of what constitutes the best counterfactual explanation must consider multiple aspects, where \"distance from the sample\" is the most common. We argue that this requirement frequently leads to explanations that are unlikely and, therefore, of limited value. Here, we present a system that provides high-likelihood explanations. We show that the search for the most likely explanations satisfying many common desiderata for counterfactual explanations can be modeled using mixed-integer optimization (MIO). In the process, we propose an MIO formulation of a Sum-Product Network (SPN) and use the SPN to estimate the likelihood of a counterfactual, which can be of independent interest. A numerical comparison against several methods for generating counterfactual explanations is provided.",

Our approach involves a non-uniform discretization of the fractional Caputo operator, facilitating swift computation of fractional derivatives within Caputo-type fractional differential problems with $0<\u03b1<1$. In this methodology, the operational matrix is precomputed, and during the training phase, automatic differentiation is replaced with a matrix-vector product. While our methodology is compatible with any network, we particularly highlight its successful implementation in PINNs, emphasizing the enhanced accuracy achieved when utilizing the Legendre Neural Block (LNB) architecture. LNB incorporates Legendre polynomials into the PINN structure, providing a significant boost in accuracy. The effectiveness of our proposed method is validated across diverse differential equations, including Delay Differential Equations (DDEs) and Systems of Differential Algebraic Equations (DAEs). To demonstrate its versatility, we extend the application of the method to systems of differential equations, specifically addressing nonlinear Pantograph fractional-order DDEs/DAEs. The results are supported by a comprehensive analysis of numerical outcomes.",

Such arrangements abound in mathematics, and are studied via the comma category $\\left[ F; G\\right]$.

Notwithstanding these preventive maintenance interventions are aimed at returning the machine to a so-called as-good-as-new state, unforeseeable factors may imply that maintenance interventions are not perfect and the machine is only returned to an earlier (uncertain) state of wear. The problem is modelled as a restless bandit problem and an index policy for the sequential allocation of maintenance tasks is proposed. A series of numerical experiments shows the strong performance of the proposed policy. Moreover, the methodology is of interest in the general context of dynamic resource allocation and restless bandit problems, as well as being useful in the particular imperfect maintenance model described.",

Balachandran et al, Linear Algebra Appl. 658 (2023), 310-318) that if $T$ is a uniformly random tournament over $[n]$, then $\\operatorname{rank}(M_{T}) \\geq (\\frac{1}{2}-o(1))n$ with high probability when $\\operatorname{char}(\\mathbb{F}) \\neq 2$ and $f$ is a linear function.\n  In this paper, we investigate the other extremal question: how low can the ranks of such matrices be? We work with sequences $\\mathbf{a}$ that take only two distinct values, so the rank of any such $n \\times n$ matrix is at least $n/2$. First, we show that the rank of any such matrix depends on whether an associated bipartite graph has certain eigenvalues of high multiplicity. Using this, we show that if $f$ is linear, then there are real matrices $M_{T}(f;\\mathbf{a})$ of rank at most $\\frac{n}{2} + O(1)$. For rational matrices, we show that for each $\\varepsilon > 0$ we can find a sequence $\\mathbf{a}(\\varepsilon)$ for which there are matrices $M_{T}(f;\\mathbf{a})$ of rank at most $(\\frac{1}{2} + \\varepsilon)n + O(1)$. These matrices are constructed from symmetric designs, and we also use them to produce bisection-closed families of size greater than $\\lfloor 3n/2 \\rfloor - 2$ for $n \\leq 15$, which improves the previously best known bound (cf. Balachandran et al, Electron J. Combin. 26 (2019), #P2.40).",

        "abstract": "Inequality measures are quantitative measures that take values in the unit interval, with a zero value characterizing perfect equality. Although originally proposed to measure economic inequalities, they can be applied to several other situations, in which one is interested in the mutual variability between a set of observations, rather than in their deviations from the mean. While unidimensional measures of inequality, such as the Gini index, are widely known and employed, multidimensional measures, such as Lorenz Zonoids, are difficult to interpret and computationally expensive and, for these reasons, are not much well known. To overcome the problem, in this paper we propose a new scaling invariant multidimensional inequality index, based on the Fourier transform, which exhibits a number of interesting properties, and whose application to the multidimensional case is rather straightforward to calculate and interpret.",
