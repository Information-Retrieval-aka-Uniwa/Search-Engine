        "abstract": "A pervasive phenomenon in machine learning applications is distribution shift, where training and deployment conditions for a machine learning model differ. As distribution shift typically results in a degradation in performance, much attention has been devoted to algorithmic interventions that mitigate these detrimental effects. In this paper, we study the effect of distribution shift in the presence of model misspecification, specifically focusing on $L_{\\infty}$-misspecified regression and adversarial covariate shift, where the regression target remains fixed while the covariate distribution changes arbitrarily. We show that empirical risk minimization, or standard least squares regression, can result in undesirable misspecification amplification where the error due to misspecification is amplified by the density ratio between the training and testing distributions. As our main result, we develop a new algorithm -- inspired by robust optimization techniques -- that avoids this undesirable behavior, resulting in no misspecification amplification while still obtaining optimal statistical rates. As applications, we use this regression procedure to obtain new guarantees in offline and online reinforcement learning with misspecification and establish new separations between previously studied structural conditions and notions of coverage.",

We call the resulting distance the smoothed empirical martingale projection distance (SE-MPD), for which we obtain an explicit characterization. We also show that the space of martingale couplings remains invariant under the smoothing operation. We study the asymptotic limit of the SE-MPD, which converges at a parametric rate as the sample size increases if the pairs are either i.i.d. or satisfy appropriate mixing assumptions. Additional finite-sample results are also investigated. Using these results, we introduce a novel consistent martingale coupling hypothesis test, which we apply to test the existence of arbitrage opportunities in recently introduced neural network-based generative models for asset pricing calibration.",

The case of weakly $p$-coercive operators with $p>1$, including the $p$-Laplacian and in particular the Laplace-Beltrami operator for $p=2$, has been considered in a recent paper of ours. As a consequence of the main results we infer comparison principles for that kind of operators. Furthermore we apply them to geometric situations dealing with the mean curvature operator, which is a typical weakly 1-coercive operator. We first consider the case of $\\mathcal C^1$ operators $L$ acting on functions $u$ of class $\\mathcal C^2$ and, in the last section of the paper, we show how our results can be extended to the case of less regular operators $L$ acting on functions $u$ which are just continuous and locally $W^{1,1}$ regular.",

This approach is referred to as coded elastic computing. Some limitations of this approach include that it assumes all virtual machines have the same computing speeds and storage capacities, and it cannot tolerate stragglers for matrix-matrix multiplications. In order to resolve these limitations, in this paper, we introduce a new combinatorial optimization framework, named uncoded storage coded transmission elastic computing (USCTEC), for heterogeneous speeds and storage constraints, aiming to minimize the expected computation time for matrix-matrix multiplications, under the consideration of straggler tolerance. Within this framework, we propose optimal solutions with straggler tolerance under relaxed storage constraints. Moreover, we propose a heuristic algorithm that considers the heterogeneous storage constraints. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms baseline solutions utilizing cyclic storage placements, in terms of both expected computation time and storage size.",

This approach constructs a low-dimensional model using only data and knowledge of the Hamiltonian function. Such ROMs can keep the intrinsic structure of the system, allowing them to capture the physics described by the governing equations. In this work, we extend this approach to more general systems that are either conservative or dissipative in energy, and which possess a gradient structure. We derive the optimization problems for inferring structure-preserving ROMs that preserve the gradient structure. We further derive an {\\em a priori} error estimate for the reduced-order approximation. To test the algorithms, we consider semi-discretized partial differential equations with gradient structure, such as the parameterized wave and Korteweg-de-Vries equations in the conservative case and the one- and two-dimensional Allen-Cahn equations in the dissipative case. The numerical results illustrate the accuracy, structure-preservation properties, and predictive capabilities of the gradient-preserving Operator Inference ROMs.",

Its dynamics are naturally continuous and described by a set of ordinary differential equations that have been proven to be useful for the optimization of continuous variables non-convex quadratic optimization problems. The dynamics of such Continuous Variable CIMs (CV-CIM) encourage optimization via optical pulses whose amplitudes are determined by the negative gradient of the objective; however, standard gradient descent is known to be trapped by local minima and hampered by poor problem conditioning. In this work, we propose to modify the CV-CIM dynamics using more sophisticated pulse injections based on tried-and-true optimization techniques such as momentum and Adam. Through numerical experiments, we show that the momentum and Adam updates can significantly speed up the CV-CIM's convergence and improve sample diversity over the original CV-CIM dynamics. We also find that the Adam-CV-CIM's performance is more stable as a function of feedback strength, especially on poorly conditioned instances, resulting in an algorithm that is more robust, reliable, and easily tunable. More broadly, we identify the CIM dynamical framework as a fertile opportunity for exploring the intersection of classical optimization and modern analog computing.",

        "abstract": "The goal of this paper is to rigorously interrogate conventional wisdom about centralization in block-building (due to, e.g., MEV and private order flow) and the outsourcing of block-building by validators to specialists (i.e., proposer-builder separation):\n  1. Does heterogeneity in skills and knowledge across block producers inevitably lead to centralization?\n  2. Does proposer-builder separation eliminate heterogeneity and preserve decentralization among proposers?\n  This paper develops mathematical models and results that offer answers to these questions:\n  1. In a game-theoretic model with endogenous staking, heterogeneous block producer rewards, and staking costs, we quantify the extent to which heterogeneous rewards lead to concentration in the equilibrium staking distribution.\n  2. In a stochastic model in which heterogeneous block producers repeatedly reinvest rewards into staking, we quantify, as a function of the block producer heterogeneity, the rate at which stake concentrates on the most sophisticated block producers.\n  3. In a model with heterogeneous proposers and specialized builders, we quantify, as a function of the competitiveness of the builder ecosystem, the extent to which proposer-builder separation reduces the heterogeneity in rewards across different proposers.\n  Our models and results take advantage of connections to contest design, P\u00f3lya urn processes, and auction theory.",

        "abstract": "We derive basic differential geometric formulae for surfaces in hyperbolic space represented as envelopes of horospheres. The dual notion of parallel hypersurfaces is also studied. The representation is applied to prove existence and regularity theorems for Weingarten surfaces in H^3, which satisfy (1-a)K = a(2-H), for an a < 0, and have a specified boundary curve at infinity. These surfaces are shown to be closely connected to conformal mappings of domains in S^2 into the unit disk and provide Riemannian interpretations for some conformal invariants associated to such mappings.\n  This paper was originally written in 1984, before I learned to use TeX, and was typed by one of the secretaries in the Princeton Math Department. It was more or less, my first original work after my dissertation. For some reason, I was not able to get this paper published in a timely manner. The results and perspective in this paper have proved to be useful to a variety of people, some of whom asked me to render the article into TeX and post it to the arXiv. I had been seriously thinking about doing this, when Martin Bridgemen sent me a transcription of my original article into TeX. I am extremely grateful to him for the effort he has put into this project.\n  The paper is now formatted in a more or less modern AMS-article style, but for lots of additional punctuation, a few corrections and some minor stylistic changes, the content has been largely reproduced as it originally was. Remarks about the 'state-of-the-art' in hyperbolic geometry are obviously way out of date, as there has been enormous progress in many aspects of this still rich subject.",

Quantum algorithms addressing this problem have hitherto been constrained to special normal matrices assuming spectral decomposition, leaving the extension to general matrices an open challenge. In this work, we present a novel family of quantum algorithms tailored for solving the eigenvalue problem for general matrices, encompassing scenarios with complex eigenvalues or even defective matrices. Our approach begins by tackling the task of searching for an eigenvalue without additional constraints. For diagonalizable matrices, our algorithm has $\\tilde O(\\varepsilon^{-1})$ complexity with an error $\\varepsilon$, achieving the nearly Heisenberg scaling. Subsequently, we study the identification of eigenvalues closest to a specified point or line, extending the results for ground energy and energy gap problems in Hermitian matrices. We achieve an accuracy scaling of $\\tilde O(\\varepsilon^{-2})$ for general diagonalizable matrices, further refining to $\\tilde O(\\varepsilon^{-1})$ under the condition of real eigenvalues or constant distance from the reference point. The algorithm's foundation lies in the synergy of three techniques: the relationship between eigenvalues of matrix $A$ and the minimum singular value of $A-\u03bcI$, quantum singular value threshold subroutine extended from quantum singular-value estimation, and problem-specific searching algorithms. Our algorithms find applications in diverse domains, including estimating the relaxation time of Markov chains, solving Liouvillian gaps in open quantum systems, and verifying PT-symmetry broken/unbroken phases. These applications underscore the significance of our quantum eigensolvers for problems across various disciplines.",

The model-specific TreeSHAP methodology solves the exponential complexity for retrieving exact SVs from tree-based models. Expanding beyond individual feature attribution, Shapley interactions reveal the impact of intricate feature interactions of any order. In this work, we present TreeSHAP-IQ, an efficient method to compute any-order additive Shapley interactions for predictions of tree-based models. TreeSHAP-IQ is supported by a mathematical framework that exploits polynomial arithmetic to compute the interaction scores in a single recursive traversal of the tree, akin to Linear TreeSHAP.

        "abstract": "Mathematical optimization is now widely regarded as an indispensable modeling and solution tool for the design of wireless communications systems. While optimization has played a significant role in the revolutionary progress in wireless communication and networking technologies from 1G to 5G and onto the future 6G, the innovations in wireless technologies have also substantially transformed the nature of the underlying mathematical optimization problems upon which the system designs are based and have sparked significant innovations in the development of methodologies to understand, to analyze, and to solve those problems. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of recent advances in mathematical optimization theory and algorithms for wireless communication system design. We begin by illustrating common features of mathematical optimization problems arising in wireless communication system design. We discuss various scenarios and use cases and their associated mathematical structures from an optimization perspective. We then provide an overview of recent advances in mathematical optimization theory and algorithms, from nonconvex optimization, global optimization, and integer programming, to distributed optimization and learning-based optimization. The key to successful solution of mathematical optimization problems is in carefully choosing and/or developing suitable optimization algorithms (or neural network architectures) that can exploit the underlying problem structure. We conclude the paper by identifying several open research challenges and outlining future research directions.",

This manuscript approaches the classical problem by simulating movement through rainfall using MATLAB. Our simulation was generalizable to include snowfall as well. An increase in walking speed resulted in a corresponding decrease in raindrop and snowflake collisions. When raindrops or snowflakes were given a horizontal movement vector due to wind, a local minimum in collisions was achieved when moving in parallel with the same horizontal speed as the raindrop; no local minimum was detected with antiparallel movement. In general, our simulation revealed that the faster one moves, the drier one remains.",

In contrast to classical network interdiction models where the leader is subject to a single budget constraint, in our setting, both the leader and the follower are subject to several independent cardinality constraints and engage in a zero-sum game. While a single-level linear integer programming problem over a partition matroid is known to be polynomially solvable, we prove that the considered bilevel problem is NP-hard, even when the objective function coefficients are all binary. On a positive note, it turns out that, if the number of cardinality constraints is fixed for either the leader or the follower, then the considered class of bilevel problems admits several polynomial-time solution schemes. Specifically, these schemes are based on a single-level dual reformulation, a dynamic programming-based approach, and a 2-flip local search algorithm for the leader.",

We study the arithmetic dynamical degree of $(X,f)$ and establish the relative degree formula. The relative degree formula gives a proof of the fundamental inequality $\\ov\u03b1(f,x)\\leq \u03bb_1(f)$ in this setting. By taking a spread-out, we extend the definition of arithmetic degrees to dynamical systems over the field $\\mathbf k$ of characteristic $0$. We demonstrate that our definition is independent of the choice of the spread-out. Moreover, in this setting, we prove certain special cases of the Kawaguchi-Silverman conjecture. A main novelty of this paper is that, we give a characterization of arithmetic degrees of \"transcendental points\" in the case $\\mathbf k=\\C$, from which we deduce that $\u03b1(f,x)=\u03bb_1(f)$ for very general $x\\in X(\\mb{C})$ when $f$ is an endomorphism.",

We then deduce equivalent conditions for the injectivity of the parity transformation on any subset of all equivalences classes of graphs. Moreover, we show concrete examples of optimization problems demonstrating that the parity transformation is not an injective mapping, and also introduce an important class of plaquette layouts and their corresponding set of constraints whose preimage is uniquely determined.

The semi-implicit formulation has two advantages compared with the explicit approach: the time step is independent of the water phase, and the pore pressure field is more stable. The semi-implicit MPM models based on the incremental fractional-step method available in the literature consist of modelling the soil and water mixture using a single set of material points only, in order to save computational time. In this study, we further derive this formulation with two sets of material points to represent the soil and water phases separately. The stress oscillations that are frequently found in the water and soil phases are stabilised with this approach. A new stabilisation method is developed based on the modified F-bar method. The proposed method is validated with two numerical examples under small and large deformations, respectively. After that, Nor-Sand constitutive soil model is used to simulate landslides. Numerical examples show an excellent performance of the proposed coupled MPM and the stabilisation method. The formulation with two sets of material points yields significantly different but more reliable results in the landslides analysis, compared with the single-point approach. Additionally, this research shows that the additional computational cost caused by the additional water material points is acceptable. Therefore, it is recommended to use two sets of material points for certain large deformation geotechnical problems.",

We specifically consider this extension for a derivative-free optimizer, the ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI).

We analyze our new method, presenting results related to the control of our particle system through its covariance structure. This analysis includes moment bounds and an ensemble collapse, which are essential for demonstrating a convergence result. We establish convergence in expectation and validate our theoretical findings through experiments with dynamic-EKI applied to a 2D Darcy flow partial differential equation.",

Traditional approaches tackling such a problem require the computation of tensor Singular Value Decomposition (t-SVD), that is a computationally intensive process, rendering them impractical for dealing with large-scale tensors. Aim to address this challenge, we propose an efficient and effective low-tubal-rank tensor recovery method based on a factorization procedure akin to the Burer-Monteiro (BM) method. Precisely, our fundamental approach involves decomposing a large tensor into two smaller factor tensors, followed by solving the problem through factorized gradient descent (FGD). This strategy eliminates the need for t-SVD computation, thereby reducing computational costs and storage requirements. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis to ensure the convergence of FGD under both noise-free and noisy situations. Additionally, it is worth noting that our method does not require the precise estimation of the tensor tubal-rank. Even in cases where the tubal-rank is slightly overestimated, our approach continues to demonstrate robust performance. A series of experiments have been carried out to demonstrate that, as compared to other popular ones, our approach exhibits superior performance in multiple scenarios, in terms of the faster computational speed and the smaller convergence error.",

When the mean degree $np$ diverges, the empirical spectral measure of the normalized Hadamard product $(A \\circ \u039e)/\\sqrt{np}$ converges weakly in probability to the semicircle law. In the regime where $p\\ll 1$ and $ np \\gg \\log n$, we prove a large deviations principle for the empirical spectral measure with speed $n^2p$ and with a good rate function solution of a certain variational problem. The rate function reveals in particular that the only possible deviations at the exponential scale $n^2p$ are around measures coming from Quadratic Vector Equations. As a byproduct, we obtain a large deviations principle for the empirical spectral measure of supercritical Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graphs.",

We provide a common generalisation of the frequently used concepts of ampleness and copiousness.\n  We give a detailed investigation of the abundance for Condorcet domains. Our theorems imply a ceiling for the local diversity in domains on large sets of alternatives, which show that in this measure Black's single-peaked domain is in fact optimal. We also demonstrate that for some numbers of alternatives, there are Condorcet domains which have largest local diversity without having maximum order.",

We discuss how the shape uncertainties can be modelled using the domain mapping approach and how the deformation mapping can be expressed as coefficients in Maxwell's equations. Using derivatives of these coefficients and derivatives of the eigenpairs, we follow a perturbation approach to compute approximations of mean and covariance of the eigenpairs. For small perturbations, these approximations are faster and more accurate than Monte Carlo or similar sampling-based strategies. Numerical experiments for a three-dimensional 9-cell TESLA cavity are presented.",

One of the main obstacles in applying supervised paradigms to such problems is the requirement of expensive target solutions as ground-truth, often produced with costly exact solvers. Inspired by Semi- and Self-Supervised learning, we show that it is possible to easily train generative models by sampling multiple solutions and using the best one according to the problem objective as a pseudo-label. In this way, we iteratively improve the model generation capability by relying only on its self-supervision, completely removing the need for optimality information. We prove the effectiveness of this Self-Labeling strategy on the Job Shop Scheduling (JSP), a complex combinatorial problem that is receiving much attention from the Reinforcement Learning community. We propose a generative model based on the well-known Pointer Network and train it with our strategy. Experiments on two popular benchmarks demonstrate the potential of this approach as the resulting models outperform constructive heuristics and current state-of-the-art Reinforcement Learning proposals.",

Secondly, existing literature predominantly concentrates on single-fidelity (SF) data, which imposes limitations on its applicability due to the computational cost. In this paper, we present two novel approaches to address these problems from the view of uncertainty quantification. We construct a surrogate model employing the Gaussian process regression (GPR) to mitigate the effect of noise in the observed data, quantify its uncertainty, and ultimately recover the equations accurately. Subsequently, we exploit the multi-fidelity Gaussian processes (MFGP) to address scenarios involving multi-fidelity (MF), sparse, and noisy observed data. We demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our methodologies through several numerical experiments.",

In other words, we cannot deal with the Cauchy problem of semi-linear evolution equations with $S_{\u03b1,p,q}(u)$ and $L^{1}$-initial velocity.\n  We will show that $S_{\u03b1,p,q}(u)$ produces the same semi-critical exponent that guarantees the global existence of small data solutions as in the well known generalized Hartree nonlinearity $H_{\u03b1,p,q}(u)=|u|^{p}I_\u03b1(|u|^{q})$ provided that the initial velocity belongs to $L^{m}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$, with $m>1$.\n  We can expect a relation between some physical systems that are modeled and solved using Hartree nonlinearity and those in their modified form due to this coincidence property in the semi-critical exponent.",

In recent years, they have been widely used for data visualization on planar domains and planar parameterization of open surfaces. However, the theory and computation of density-equalizing maps for closed surfaces are much less explored. In this work, we develop a novel method for computing spherical density-equalizing maps for genus-0 closed surfaces. Specifically, we first compute a conformal parameterization of the given genus-0 closed surface onto the unit sphere. Then, we perform density equalization on the spherical domain based on the given density information to achieve a spherical density-equalizing map. The bijectivity of the mapping is guaranteed using quasi-conformal theory. We further propose a method for incorporating the harmonic energy and landmark constraints into our formulation to achieve landmark-aligned spherical density-equalizing maps balancing different distortion measures. Using the proposed methods, a large variety of spherical parameterizations can be achieved. Applications to surface registration, remeshing, and data visualization are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.",

To demonstrate the advantages of the particle method under consideration, a comparison with other numerical methods for viscous compressible fluid models is provided. Since the solutions of the macroscopic traffic model can be approximated by the solutions of a reduced model consisting of a single nonlinear heat-type partial differential equation, the numerical solutions produced by the particle method are also compared with the numerical solutions of the reduced model.

Such equations frequently arise from the state-dependent Riccati equation approach which is perhaps the only systematic way today to study nonlinear control problems. Often involved Riccati-type equations are of small scale, but have to be solved repeatedly in real time. Important applications include the 3D missile/target engagement, the F16 aircraft flight control, and the quadrotor optimal control, to name a few. A new inner-outer iterative method that combines the fixed-point strategy and the structure-preserving doubling algorithm (SDA) is proposed. It is proved that the method is monotonically convergent, and in particular, taking the zero matrix as initial, the method converges to the desired stabilizing solution. Previously, Newton's method has been called to solve SCARE, but it was mostly investigated from its theoretic aspect than numerical aspect in terms of robust and efficient numerical implementation. For that reason, we revisit Newton's method for SCARE, focusing on how to calculate each Newton iterative step efficiently so that Newton's method for SCARE can become practical. It is proposed to use our new inner-outer iterative method, which is provably convergent, to provide critical initial starting points for Newton's method to ensure its convergence. Finally several numerical experiments are conducted to validate the new method and robust implementation of Newton's method.",

However, limited effort has been attempted to compute the fractal dimension of surfaces computed from precisely known atomic coordinates from computational biomolecular and nanomaterial studies. This work proposes methods to estimate the fractal dimension of the surface of any three-dimensional object composed of spheres, by representing it as either a voxelised point cloud or a mathematically exact surface, and computing its box-counting dimension. Sphractal is published as a Python package that provides these functionalities, and its utility is demonstrated on a set of simulated palladium nanoparticle data.",

On the other hand, the conjugate residual (CR) method, closely related CG and introduced by Stiefel in 1955 for the same settings, remains relatively less known outside the numerical linear algebra community. Since their inception, these methods -- henceforth collectively referred to as conjugate direction methods -- have been extended beyond positive definite to indefinite, albeit consistent, settings. Going one step further, in this paper, we investigate theoretical and empirical properties of these methods under inconsistent systems. Among other things, we show that small modifications to the original algorithms allow for the pseudo-inverse solution. Furthermore, we show that CR is essentially equivalent to the minimum residual method, proposed by Paige and Saunders in 1975, in such contexts. Lastly, we conduct a series of numerical experiments to shed lights on their numerical stability (or lack thereof) and their performance for inconsistent systems. Surprisingly, we will demonstrate that, unlike CR and contrary to popular belief, CG can exhibit significant numerical instability, bordering on catastrophe in some instances.",

However, compared to the empirical success, its rigorous theoretical analysis has yet to be touched. This work goes preliminary steps toward the mathematical runtime analysis of ENAS. In particular, we define a binary classification problem UNIFORM, and formulate an explicit fitness function to represent the relationship between neural architecture and classification accuracy. Furthermore, we consider (1+1)-ENAS algorithm with mutation to optimize the neural architecture, and obtain the following runtime bounds: 1) the one-bit mutation finds the optimum in an expected runtime of $O(n)$ and $\u03a9(\\log n)$; 2) the multi-bit mutation finds the optimum in an expected runtime of $\u0398(n)$. These theoretical results show that one-bit and multi-bit mutations achieve nearly the same performance on UNIFORM. We provide insight into the choices of mutation in the ENAS community: although multi-bit mutation can change the step size to prevent a local trap, this may not always improve runtime. Empirical results also verify the equivalence of these two mutation operators. This work begins the runtime analysis of ENAS, laying the foundation for further theoretical studies to guide the design of ENAS.",

By utilizing our novel algorithm formulae, nonlinear coupled systems can maintain a stable state of synchronization after appropriate weight adjustments. We present several variants of the DLS techniques including the self-adaptive, the supervised and the hybrid methods, all of which reliably demonstrate their capability to facilitate synchronization in heterogeneous networks, such as small-world, scale-free, and random networks. As application of DLS technique, we first validate the efficacy of our DLS technique by using a simple FitzHugh-Nagumo neural network, and the effects of the technique on both global and local synchronization are studied. Then the DLS technique is applied to a complex nonlinear system, i.e., the network of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons with chemical synaptic coupling model. This study offers a novel perspective on comprehending synchronization phenomena within nonlinear systems.",

In this paper, we mainly focus on the influence of the absence of this symmetry on the traveling waves of the NLS system. Firstly, we obtain the existence of traveling solitary wave solutions that are non-radial and complex-valued. Secondly, using the asymptotic analysis method, when the frequency is sufficiently large, we establish the high frequency limit of the traveling solitary wave solution. Finally, for the mass critical case, we provide a novel condition for the existence of global solutions which is significantly different from the classical. In particular, this new condition breaks the traditional optimal assumption about initial data.",

In this paper, we introduce S-Seg, a novel model that can achieve surprisingly strong performance without depending on any of the above elements. S-Seg leverages pseudo-mask and language to train a MaskFormer, and can be easily trained from publicly available image-text datasets. Contrary to prior works, our model directly trains for pixel-level features and language alignment. Once trained, S-Seg generalizes well to multiple testing datasets without requiring fine-tuning. In addition, S-Seg has the extra benefits of scalability with data and consistently improvement when augmented with self-training. We believe that our simple yet effective approach will serve as a solid baseline for future research.",

As distribution shift typically results in a degradation in performance, much attention has been devoted to algorithmic interventions that mitigate these detrimental effects. In this paper, we study the effect of distribution shift in the presence of model misspecification, specifically focusing on $L_{\\infty}$-misspecified regression and adversarial covariate shift, where the regression target remains fixed while the covariate distribution changes arbitrarily. We show that empirical risk minimization, or standard least squares regression, can result in undesirable misspecification amplification where the error due to misspecification is amplified by the density ratio between the training and testing distributions. As our main result, we develop a new algorithm -- inspired by robust optimization techniques -- that avoids this undesirable behavior, resulting in no misspecification amplification while still obtaining optimal statistical rates. As applications, we use this regression procedure to obtain new guarantees in offline and online reinforcement learning with misspecification and establish new separations between previously studied structural conditions and notions of coverage.",

Specifically, we delved into LoRA, a representative PEFT method, and compared it against full-parameter fine-tuning (FFT) on two self-supervised radiography foundation models across three well-established chest radiograph datasets. Our results showed that LoRA outperformed FFT in 13 out of 18 transfer learning tasks by at most 2.9% using fewer than 1% tunable parameters. Combining LoRA with foundation models, we set up new state-of-the-art on a range of data-efficient learning tasks, such as an AUROC score of 80.6% using 1% labeled data on NIH ChestX-ray14. We hope this study can evoke more attention from the community in the use of PEFT for transfer learning on medical imaging tasks. Code and models are available at https://github.com/RL4M/MED-PEFT.",

Inspired by well-known results for the call-by-name $\u03bb$-calculus (CbN), where meaningful terms are identified to the solvable ones, this paper validates the challenging claim that the notion of potential valuability (aka scrutability), previously introduced in the literature, adequately represents meaningfulness in the call-by-value $\u03bb$-calculus (CbV). Akin to CbN, this claim is corroborated by proving two essential properties. The first one is genericity, stating that meaningless subterms have no bearing on evaluating normalizing terms. To prove this, we use a novel approach based on stratified reduction, indifferently applicable to CbN and CbV. The second property concerns consistency of the smallest congruence relation resulting from equating all meaningless terms (without equating all terms). We also show that such a congruence has a unique consistent and maximal extension, which coincides with a natural notion of observational equivalence. Our results thus supply the formal concepts and tools that validate the informal notion of meaningfulness underlying CbN and CbV.",

        "abstract": "Chest X-rays (CXRs) are the most frequently performed imaging test in clinical practice. Recent advances in the development of vision-language foundation models (FMs) give rise to the possibility of performing automated CXR interpretation, which can assist physicians with clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes. However, developing FMs that can accurately interpret CXRs is challenging due to the (1) limited availability of large-scale vision-language datasets in the medical image domain, (2) lack of vision and language encoders that can capture the complexities of medical data, and (3) absence of evaluation frameworks for benchmarking the abilities of FMs on CXR interpretation. In this work, we address these challenges by first introducing \\emph{CheXinstruct} - a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset curated from 28 publicly-available datasets. We then present \\emph{CheXagent} - an instruction-tuned FM capable of analyzing and summarizing CXRs. To build CheXagent, we design a clinical large language model (LLM) for parsing radiology reports, a vision encoder for representing CXR images, and a network to bridge the vision and language modalities. Finally, we introduce \\emph{CheXbench} - a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate FMs across 8 clinically-relevant CXR interpretation tasks. Extensive quantitative evaluations and qualitative reviews with five expert radiologists demonstrate that CheXagent outperforms previously-developed general- and medical-domain FMs on CheXbench tasks. Furthermore, in an effort to improve model transparency, we perform a fairness evaluation across factors of sex, race and age to highlight potential performance disparities.

        "abstract": "We study the rate-distortion-perception (RDP) tradeoff for a memoryless source model in the asymptotic limit of large block-lengths. Our perception measure is based on a divergence between the distributions of the source and reconstruction sequences conditioned on the encoder output, which was first proposed in [1], [2]. We consider the case when there is no shared randomness between the encoder and the decoder. For the case of discrete memoryless sources we derive a single-letter characterization of the RDP function, thus settling a problem that remains open for the marginal metric introduced in Blau and Michaeli [3] (with no shared randomness). Our achievability scheme is based on lossy source coding with a posterior reference map proposed in [4]. For the case of continuous valued sources under squared error distortion measure and squared quadratic Wasserstein perception measure we also derive a single-letter characterization and show that a noise-adding mechanism at the decoder suffices to achieve the optimal representation. For the case of zero perception loss, we show that our characterization interestingly coincides with the results for the marginal metric derived in [5], [6] and again demonstrate that zero perception loss can be achieved with a $3$-dB penalty in the minimum distortion. Finally we specialize our results to the case of Gaussian sources. We derive the RDP function for vector Gaussian sources and propose a waterfilling type solution. We also partially characterize the RDP function for a mixture of vector Gaussians.",

The process involves a sequential application of logic minimization heuristics (``synthesis recipe\"), with their arrangement significantly impacting crucial metrics such as area and delay. Addressing the challenge posed by the broad spectrum of design complexities - from variations of past designs (e.g., adders and multipliers) to entirely novel configurations (e.g., innovative processor instructions) - requires a nuanced `synthesis recipe` guided by human expertise and intuition. This study conducts a thorough examination of learning and search techniques for logic synthesis, unearthing a surprising revelation: pre-trained agents, when confronted with entirely novel designs, may veer off course, detrimentally affecting the search trajectory. We present ABC-RL, a meticulously tuned $\u03b1$ parameter that adeptly adjusts recommendations from pre-trained agents during the search process. Computed based on similarity scores through nearest neighbor retrieval from the training dataset, ABC-RL yields superior synthesis recipes tailored for a wide array of hardware designs. Our findings showcase substantial enhancements in the Quality-of-result (QoR) of synthesized circuits, boasting improvements of up to 24.8% compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, ABC-RL achieves an impressive up to 9x reduction in runtime (iso-QoR) when compared to current state-of-the-art methodologies.",

Classification is useful for the study of individual objects, statistics for population studies, as well as for anomaly detection, i.e., the identification of new unexplored phenomena, including transients and spectrally extreme sources. Despite the importance of this task, classification remains challenging in X-ray astronomy due to the lack of optical counterparts and representative training sets. We develop an alternative methodology that employs an unsupervised machine learning approach to provide probabilistic classes to Chandra Source Catalog sources with a limited number of labeled sources, and without ancillary information from optical and infrared catalogs. We provide a catalog of probabilistic classes for 8,756 sources, comprising a total of 14,507 detections, and demonstrate the success of the method at identifying emission from young stellar objects, as well as distinguishing between small-scale and large-scale compact accretors with a significant level of confidence. We investigate the consistency between the distribution of features among classified objects and well-established astrophysical hypotheses such as the unified AGN model. This provides interpretability to the probabilistic classifier. Code and tables are available publicly through GitHub.

We now have vision models capable of recognizing objects based on language queries, navigation systems that can effectively control mobile systems, and grasping models that can handle a wide range of objects. Despite these advancements, general-purpose applications of robotics still lag behind, even though they rely on these fundamental capabilities of recognition, navigation, and grasping. In this paper, we adopt a systems-first approach to develop a new Open Knowledge-based robotics framework called OK-Robot. By combining Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for object detection, navigation primitives for movement, and grasping primitives for object manipulation, OK-Robot offers a integrated solution for pick-and-drop operations without requiring any training. To evaluate its performance, we run OK-Robot in 10 real-world home environments. The results demonstrate that OK-Robot achieves a 58.5% success rate in open-ended pick-and-drop tasks, representing a new state-of-the-art in Open Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation (OVMM) with nearly 1.8x the performance of prior work. On cleaner, uncluttered environments, OK-Robot's performance increases to 82%. However, the most important insight gained from OK-Robot is the critical role of nuanced details when combining Open Knowledge systems like VLMs with robotic modules.

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning over pretrained LMs reduces training memory by updating a small number of LM parameters but does not improve inference efficiency. Structured pruning improves LM inference efficiency by removing consistent parameter blocks, yet often increases training memory and time. To improve both training and inference efficiency, we introduce APT that adaptively prunes and tunes parameters for the LMs. At the early stage of fine-tuning, APT dynamically adds salient tuning parameters for fast and accurate convergence while discarding unimportant parameters for efficiency. Compared to baselines, our experiments show that APT maintains up to 98% task performance when pruning RoBERTa and T5 models with 40% parameters left while keeping 86.4% LLaMA models' performance with 70% parameters remained. Furthermore, APT speeds up LMs fine-tuning by up to 8x and reduces large LMs memory training footprint by up to 70%.",

After a propulsion system anomaly prevented capture in lunar orbit, LF was ejected from the Earth-Moon system and into heliocentric space. NASA subsequently transferred ownership of LF to Georgia Tech to conduct an unfunded extended mission to demonstrate further advanced technology objectives, including LONEStar. From August-December 2023, the LONEStar team performed on-orbit calibration of the optical instrument and a number of different OPNAV experiments. This campaign included the processing of nearly 400 images of star fields, Earth and Moon, and four other planets (Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn). LONEStar provided the first on-orbit demonstrations of heliocentric navigation using only optical observations of planets. Of special note is the successful in-flight demonstration of (1) instantaneous triangulation with simultaneous sightings of two planets with the LOST algorithm and (2) dynamic triangulation with sequential sightings of multiple planets.",

However, most detection techniques rely on large external probes and antennas for data collection and require a long measurement time to detect Trojans. Such limitations make these techniques impractical for run-time deployment and ineffective in detecting small Trojans with subtle side-channel signatures. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Programmable Sensor Array (PSA) for run-time hardware Trojan detection, localization, and identification. PSA is a tampering-resilient integrated on-chip magnetic field sensor array that can be re-programmed to change the sensors' shape, size, and location. Using PSA, EM side-channel measurement results collected from sensors at different locations on an IC can be analyzed to localize and identify the Trojan. The PSA has better performance than conventional external magnetic probes and state-of-the-art on-chip single-coil magnetic field sensors. We fabricated an AES-128 test chip with four AES Hardware Trojans. They were successfully detected, located, and identified with the proposed on-chip PSA within 10 milliseconds using our proposed cross-domain analysis.",

        "abstract": "Representing textual information as real-numbered embeddings has become the norm in NLP. Moreover, with the rise of public interest in large language models (LLMs), Embeddings as a Service (EaaS) has rapidly gained traction as a business model. This is not without outstanding security risks, as previous research has demonstrated that sensitive data can be reconstructed from embeddings, even without knowledge of the underlying model that generated them. However, such work is limited by its sole focus on English, leaving all other languages vulnerable to attacks by malicious actors. %As many international and multilingual companies leverage EaaS, there is an urgent need for research into multilingual LLM security. To this end, this work investigates LLM security from the perspective of multilingual embedding inversion. Concretely, we define the problem of black-box multilingual and cross-lingual inversion attacks, with special attention to a cross-domain scenario. Our findings reveal that multilingual models are potentially more vulnerable to inversion attacks than their monolingual counterparts. This stems from the reduced data requirements for achieving comparable inversion performance in settings where the underlying language is not known a-priori. To our knowledge, this work is the first to delve into multilinguality within the context of inversion attacks, and our findings highlight the need for further investigation and enhanced defenses in the area of NLP Security.",

        "abstract": "Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences through reinforcement learning (RLHF) can lead to reward hacking, where LLMs exploit failures in the reward model (RM) to achieve seemingly high rewards without meeting the underlying objectives. We identify two primary challenges when designing RMs to mitigate reward hacking: distribution shifts during the RL process and inconsistencies in human preferences. As a solution, we propose Weight Averaged Reward Models (WARM), first fine-tuning multiple RMs, then averaging them in the weight space. This strategy follows the observation that fine-tuned weights remain linearly mode connected when sharing the same pre-training. By averaging weights, WARM improves efficiency compared to the traditional ensembling of predictions, while improving reliability under distribution shifts and robustness to preference inconsistencies. Our experiments on summarization tasks, using best-of-N and RL methods, shows that WARM improves the overall quality and alignment of LLM predictions; for example, a policy RL fine-tuned with WARM has a 79.4% win rate against a policy RL fine-tuned with a single RM.",

This has benefits in terms of efficiency since it offloads the cloud. ENISA and NIST security guidelines underscore the importance of enabling default local communication for safety and reliability. Indeed, an IoT device should continue to function in case the cloud connection is not available. While the security of cloud-device connections is typically strengthened through the usage of standard protocols, local connectivity security is frequently overlooked. Neglecting the security of local communication opens doors to various threats, including replay attacks. In this paper, we investigate this class of attacks by designing a systematic methodology for automatically testing IoT devices vulnerability to replay attacks. Specifically, we propose a tool, named REPLIOT, able to test whether a replay attack is successful or not, without prior knowledge of the target devices. We perform thousands of automated experiments using popular commercial devices spanning various vendors and categories. Notably, our study reveals that among these devices, 51% of them do not support local connectivity, thus they are not compliant with the reliability and safety requirements of the ENISA/NIST guidelines. We find that 75% of the remaining devices are vulnerable to replay attacks with REPLIOT having a detection accuracy of 0.98-1. Finally, we investigate the possible causes of this vulnerability, discussing possible mitigation strategies.",

In this work, we study the universality of individual neurons across GPT2 models trained from different initial random seeds, motivated by the hypothesis that universal neurons are likely to be interpretable. In particular, we compute pairwise correlations of neuron activations over 100 million tokens for every neuron pair across five different seeds and find that 1-5\\% of neurons are universal, that is, pairs of neurons which consistently activate on the same inputs. We then study these universal neurons in detail, finding that they usually have clear interpretations and taxonomize them into a small number of neuron families. We conclude by studying patterns in neuron weights to establish several universal functional roles of neurons in simple circuits: deactivating attention heads, changing the entropy of the next token distribution, and predicting the next token to (not) be within a particular set.",

        "abstract": "Detecting anomalies in poultry houses is crucial for maintaining optimal chicken health conditions, minimizing economic losses and bolstering profitability. This paper presents a novel real-time framework for analyzing chicken behavior in cage-free poultry houses to detect abnormal behaviors. Specifically, two significant abnormalities, namely inactive broiler and huddling behavior, are investigated in this study. The proposed framework comprises three key steps: (1) chicken detection utilizing a state-of-the-art deep learning model, (2) tracking individual chickens across consecutive frames with a fast tracker module, and (3) detecting abnormal behaviors within the video stream. Experimental studies are conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in accurately assessing chicken behavior. The results illustrate that our framework provides a precise and efficient solution for real-time anomaly detection, facilitating timely interventions to maintain chicken health and enhance overall productivity on poultry farms.

Our approach demonstrates remarkable adaptability in training using extensive datasets containing 3D scans and multi-view capture. Furthermore, to enhance the model's applicability for in-the-wild scenarios especially with occlusions, we propose a novel strategy that distills multi-view reconstruction into single-view via a conditional triplane diffusion model. This generative extension addresses the inherent variations in human body shapes when observed from a single view, and makes it possible to reconstruct the full body human from an occluded image. Through extensive experiments, we show that Human-LRM surpasses previous methods by a significant margin on several benchmarks.",

We create a remotely-operated minimum-maintenance wireless solution for four major seismic applications of interest. By proposing appropriate network architecture and data coordination (aggregation and transmission) designs we show that neither the low data-rate nor the low duty-cycle of LPWANs impose fundamental issues in handling a considerable amount of data created by complex seismic scenarios as long as the application is delay-tolerant. In order to confirm this claim, we cast our ideas into a practical large-scale networking design for simultaneous seismic monitoring and interferometry and carry out an analysis on the data generation and transmission rates. Finally, we present some results from a small-scale field test in which we have employed our IoT-based wireless nodes for real-time seismic quality control (QC) over clouds.",

To capture such behaviors, natural strategies are a recently proposed framework striking a balance between the ability of agents to strategize with memory and the model-checking complexity, but until now has been restricted to fully deterministic settings. For the first time, we consider the probabilistic temporal logics PATL and PATL* under natural strategies (NatPATL and NatPATL*, resp.). As main result we show that, in stochastic MAS, NatPATL model-checking is NP-complete when the active coalition is restricted to deterministic strategies. We also give a 2NEXPTIME complexity result for NatPATL* with the same restriction. In the unrestricted case, we give an EXPSPACE complexity for NatPATL and 3EXPSPACE complexity for NatPATL*.",

        "abstract": "Understanding and reasoning about spatial relationships is a fundamental capability for Visual Question Answering (VQA) and robotics. While Vision Language Models (VLM) have demonstrated remarkable performance in certain VQA benchmarks, they still lack capabilities in 3D spatial reasoning, such as recognizing quantitative relationships of physical objects like distances or size differences. We hypothesize that VLMs' limited spatial reasoning capability is due to the lack of 3D spatial knowledge in training data and aim to solve this problem by training VLMs with Internet-scale spatial reasoning data. To this end, we present a system to facilitate this approach. We first develop an automatic 3D spatial VQA data generation framework that scales up to 2 billion VQA examples on 10 million real-world images. We then investigate various factors in the training recipe, including data quality, training pipeline, and VLM architecture. Our work features the first internet-scale 3D spatial reasoning dataset in metric space. By training a VLM on such data, we significantly enhance its ability on both qualitative and quantitative spatial VQA. Finally, we demonstrate that this VLM unlocks novel downstream applications in chain-of-thought spatial reasoning and robotics due to its quantitative estimation capability.

        "abstract": "This paper studies the computational offloading of CNN inference in dynamic multi-access edge computing (MEC) networks. To address the uncertainties in communication time and computation resource availability, we propose a novel semantic compression method, autoencoder-based CNN architecture (AECNN), for effective semantic extraction and compression in partial offloading. In the semantic encoder, we introduce a feature compression module based on the channel attention mechanism in CNNs, to compress intermediate data by selecting the most informative features. In the semantic decoder, we design a lightweight decoder to reconstruct the intermediate data through learning from the received compressed data to improve accuracy. To effectively trade-off communication, computation, and inference accuracy, we design a reward function and formulate the offloading problem of CNN inference as a maximization problem with the goal of maximizing the average inference accuracy and throughput over the long term. To address this maximization problem, we propose a graph reinforcement learning-based AECNN (GRL-AECNN) method, which outperforms existing works DROO-AECNN, GRL-BottleNet++ and GRL-DeepJSCC under different dynamic scenarios. This highlights the advantages of GRL-AECNN in offloading decision-making in dynamic MEC.",

        "abstract": "Image segmentation is a clustering task whereby each pixel is assigned a cluster label. Remote sensing data usually consists of multiple bands of spectral images in which there exist semantically meaningful land cover subregions, co-registered with other source data such as LIDAR (LIght Detection And Ranging) data, where available. This suggests that, in order to account for spatial correlation between pixels, a feature vector associated with each pixel may be a vectorized tensor representing the multiple bands and a local patch as appropriate. Similarly, multiple types of texture features based on a pixel's local patch would also be beneficial for encoding locally statistical information and spatial variations, without necessarily labelling pixel-wise a large amount of ground truth, then training a supervised model, which is sometimes impractical. In this work, by resorting to label only a small quantity of pixels, a new semi-supervised segmentation approach is proposed. Initially, over all pixels, an image data matrix is created in high dimensional feature space. Then, t-SNE projects the high dimensional data onto 3D embedding. By using radial basis functions as input features, which use the labelled data samples as centres, to pair with the output class labels, a modified canonical correlation analysis algorithm, referred to as RBF-CCA, is introduced which learns the associated projection matrix via the small labelled data set. The associated canonical variables, obtained for the full image, are applied by k-means clustering algorithm. The proposed semi-supervised RBF-CCA algorithm has been implemented on several remotely sensed multispectral images, demonstrating excellent segmentation results.",

Existing measures, relying on direct observation by caregivers, lack sensitivity and specificity. In cerebral palsy, pain is a common comorbidity and a reliable evaluation protocol is crucial. Thus, having an automatic system that recognizes facial expressions could be of enormous help when diagnosing pain in this type of patient.\n  Objectives: 1) to build a dataset of facial pain expressions in individuals with cerebral palsy, and 2) to develop an automated facial recognition system based on deep learning for pain assessment addressed to this population.\n  Methods: Ten neural networks were trained on three pain image databases, including the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database, the Multimodal Intensity Pain Dataset, and the Delaware Pain Database. Additionally, a curated dataset (CPPAIN) was created, consisting of 109 preprocessed facial pain expression images from individuals with cerebral palsy, categorized by two physiotherapists using the Facial Action Coding System observational scale.\n  Results: InceptionV3 exhibited promising performance on the CP-PAIN dataset, achieving an accuracy of 62.67% and an F1 score of 61.12%. Explainable artificial intelligence techniques revealed consistent essential features for pain identification across models.\n  Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning models for robust pain detection in populations with neurological conditions and communication disabilities. The creation of a larger dataset specific to cerebral palsy would further enhance model accuracy, offering a valuable tool for discerning subtle and idiosyncratic pain expressions. The insights gained could extend to other complex neurological conditions.",

Often social activists strive to get populations to identify with some cause or notion -- like green energy, diversity, etc. in order to bring about desired social changes. We explore the problem of designing computational models for social identities in the context of autonomous AI agents. For this, we propose an agent model that enables agents to identify with certain notions and show how this affects collective outcomes. We also contrast between associations of identity with rational preferences. The proposed model is simulated in an application context of urban mobility, where we show how changes in social identity affect mobility patterns and collective outcomes.",

In order to resolve these limitations, in this paper, we introduce a new combinatorial optimization framework, named uncoded storage coded transmission elastic computing (USCTEC), for heterogeneous speeds and storage constraints, aiming to minimize the expected computation time for matrix-matrix multiplications, under the consideration of straggler tolerance. Within this framework, we propose optimal solutions with straggler tolerance under relaxed storage constraints. Moreover, we propose a heuristic algorithm that considers the heterogeneous storage constraints. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms baseline solutions utilizing cyclic storage placements, in terms of both expected computation time and storage size.",

Some recent works tend to show that anisotropy is a consequence of optimizing the cross-entropy loss on long-tailed distributions of tokens. We show in this paper that anisotropy can also be observed empirically in language models with specific objectives that should not suffer directly from the same consequences. We also show that the anisotropy problem extends to Transformers trained on other modalities. Our observations suggest that anisotropy is actually inherent to Transformers-based models.",

Its dynamics are naturally continuous and described by a set of ordinary differential equations that have been proven to be useful for the optimization of continuous variables non-convex quadratic optimization problems. The dynamics of such Continuous Variable CIMs (CV-CIM) encourage optimization via optical pulses whose amplitudes are determined by the negative gradient of the objective; however, standard gradient descent is known to be trapped by local minima and hampered by poor problem conditioning. In this work, we propose to modify the CV-CIM dynamics using more sophisticated pulse injections based on tried-and-true optimization techniques such as momentum and Adam. Through numerical experiments, we show that the momentum and Adam updates can significantly speed up the CV-CIM's convergence and improve sample diversity over the original CV-CIM dynamics. We also find that the Adam-CV-CIM's performance is more stable as a function of feedback strength, especially on poorly conditioned instances, resulting in an algorithm that is more robust, reliable, and easily tunable. More broadly, we identify the CIM dynamical framework as a fertile opportunity for exploring the intersection of classical optimization and modern analog computing.",

Understanding, identifying, and predicting fear, which is one of the fundamental human emotions, in virtual reality (VR) environments plays an essential role in immersive game development, scene development, and next-generation virtual human-computer interaction applications. In this article, we used VR horror games as a medium to analyze fear emotions by collecting multi-modal data (posture, audio, and physiological signals) from 23 players. We used an LSTM-based model to predict fear with accuracies of 65.31% and 90.47% under 6-level classification (no fear and five different levels of fear) and 2-level classification (no fear and fear), respectively. We constructed a multi-modal natural behavior dataset of immersive human fear responses (VRMN-bD) and compared it with existing relevant advanced datasets. The results show that our dataset has fewer limitations in terms of collection method, data scale and audience scope. We are unique and advanced in targeting multi-modal datasets of fear and behavior in VR stand-up interactive environments. Moreover, we discussed the implications of this work for communities and applications. The dataset and pre-trained model are available at https://github.com/KindOPSTAR/VRMN-bD.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN)-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models were studied to provide sequential relationships for each timepoint in MRIs of patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). In this pilot study, we compared three QCNN-LSTM models for binary classification of MS disability benchmarked against classical neural network architectures. Our hypothesis is that quantum models will provide competitive performance. Methods Matrix Product State (MPS), reverse Multistate Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz (MERA), and Tree-Tensor Network (TTN) circuits were paired with LSTM layer to process near-annual MRI data of patients diagnosed with MS. These were benchmarked against a Visual Geometry Group (VGG)-LSTM and a Video Vision Transformer (ViViT). Predicted logits were measured against ground truth labels of each patient's Extended Disability Severity Score (EDSS) using binary cross-entropy loss. Training/validation/holdout testing was partitioned using 5-fold cross validation with a total split of 60:20:20. Levene's test of variance was used to measure statistical difference and Student's t-test for paired model differences in mean. Results The MPS-LSTM, reverse MERA-LSTM, and TTN-LSTM had holdout testing ROC-AUC of 0.70, 0.77, and 0.81, respectively (p-value 0.915). VGG16-LSTM and ViViT performed similarly with ROC-AUC of 0.73 and 0.77, respectively (p-value 0.631). Overall variance and mean were not statistically significant (p-value 0.713), however, time to train was significantly faster for the QCNN-LSTMs (39.4 sec per fold vs. 224 and 218, respectively, p-value <0.001). Conclusion QCNN-LSTM models perform competitively to their classical counterparts with greater efficiency in train time. Clinically, these can add value in terms of efficiency to time-dependent deep learning prediction of disease progression based upon medical imaging.",

Among many others, existing methods use the following two scores to do so without training on any apriori OOD examples: a learned temperature and an energy score. In this paper we introduce Ablated Learned Temperature Energy (or \"AbeT\" for short), a method which combines these prior methods in novel ways with effective modifications. Due to these contributions, AbeT lowers the False Positive Rate at $95\\%$ True Positive Rate (FPR@95) by $35.39\\%$ in classification (averaged across all ID and OOD datasets measured) compared to state of the art without training networks in multiple stages or requiring hyperparameters or test-time backward passes. We additionally provide empirical insights as to how our model learns to distinguish between In-Distribution (ID) and OOD samples while only being explicitly trained on ID samples via exposure to misclassified ID examples at training time. Lastly, we show the efficacy of our method in identifying predicted bounding boxes and pixels corresponding to OOD objects in object detection and semantic segmentation, respectively - with an AUROC increase of $5.15\\%$ in object detection and both a decrease in FPR@95 of $41.48\\%$ and an increase in AUPRC of $34.20\\%$ on average in semantic segmentation compared to previous state of the art.",

Generative AI and its products, like ChatGPT, can create a solution for most introductory programming problems.

In this work, we present \\sys{}, a system that utilizes large language models (LLM) while still promoting students' cognitive engagement. \\sys{} provides a personalized Parsons puzzle to support struggling students. In a Parsons puzzle, students place mixed-up code blocks in the correct order to solve a problem. A technical evaluation with 800 incorrect student code demonstrated that \\sys{} can efficiently create high-quality (correct, personalized, and concise) Parsons puzzles for students. In a within-subjects experiment with 18 novice programmers, most students rated using \\sys{} as more engaging, and they preferred \\sys{} for learning rather than simply receiving an AI-generated solution. Additionally, students recalled more new elements from the supported practice to the posttest after using \\sys{}, compared to when they simply received a direct solution. Qualitative observations and interviews provided evidence for the benefits of \\sys{} including emphasizing algorithmic thinking, fostering continuity in learning, promoting metacognitive reflection, and boosting student confidence. We conclude by suggesting future designs for applying generative AI in a way that minimizes over-reliance and enhances learning.",

It consists in decreasing the population for a GA run following a predetermined schedule, configured by a speed and a severity parameter. The method uses as initial population size an estimation of the minimum size needed to supply enough building blocks, using a fixed-size selectorecombinative GA converging within some confidence interval toward good solutions for a particular problem. Following this methodology, a scalability analysis is conducted on deceptive, quasi-deceptive, and non-deceptive trap functions in order to assess whether SVPS-GA improves performances compared to a fixed-size GA under different problem instances and difficulty levels. Results show several combinations of speed-severity where SVPS-GA preserves the solution quality while improving performances, by reducing the number of evaluations needed for success.",

Does proposer-builder separation eliminate heterogeneity and preserve decentralization among proposers?\n  This paper develops mathematical models and results that offer answers to these questions:\n  1. In a game-theoretic model with endogenous staking, heterogeneous block producer rewards, and staking costs, we quantify the extent to which heterogeneous rewards lead to concentration in the equilibrium staking distribution.\n  2. In a stochastic model in which heterogeneous block producers repeatedly reinvest rewards into staking, we quantify, as a function of the block producer heterogeneity, the rate at which stake concentrates on the most sophisticated block producers.\n  3. In a model with heterogeneous proposers and specialized builders, we quantify, as a function of the competitiveness of the builder ecosystem, the extent to which proposer-builder separation reduces the heterogeneity in rewards across different proposers.\n  Our models and results take advantage of connections to contest design, P\u00f3lya urn processes, and auction theory.",

Our experiments expose the difficulty of solving such problems while showcasing the immense gap between open-source and closed-source models. We also reveal critical shortcomings with individual visual and textual modules, subjecting the models to low-performance ceilings.

These processes are typically accompanied by rapid evaporation so that the evaporation-induced recoil pressure and cooling arise as major driving forces for fluid dynamics and temperature evolution. The magnitude of these interface fluxes depends exponentially on the melt pool surface temperature, which, therefore, must be predicted with high accuracy. The present work utilizes a diffuse interface model based on a continuum surface flux (CSF) description on the interfaces to study dimensionally reduced thermal two-phase problems representing PBF-LB/M in a finite element framework. It is demonstrated that the extreme temperature gradients combined with the high ratios of material properties between metal and ambient gas lead to significant errors in the interface temperatures and fluxes when classical CSF approaches, along with typical interface thicknesses and discretizations, are applied. A novel parameter-scaled CSF approach is proposed, which is constructed to yield a smoother temperature rate in the diffuse interface region, significantly increasing the solution accuracy. The interface thickness required to predict the temperature field with a given level of accuracy is less restrictive by at least one order of magnitude for the proposed parameter-scaled CSF approach compared to classical CSF, drastically reducing computational costs. Finally, we showcased the general applicability of the parameter-scaled CSF to a three-dimensional simulation of stationary laser melting of PBF-LB/M considering the fully coupled thermo-hydrodynamic multi-phase problem, including phase change.",

An alternative approach known as quantum state diffusion unraveling is based on the trajectories of pure states generated by random wave functions, which evolve according to a nonlinear It\u00f4-Schr\u00f6dinger equation (ISE). This study introduces weak first- and second-order solvers for the ISE based on directly applying the It\u00f4-Taylor expansion with exact derivatives in the interaction picture. We tested the method on free and driven Morse oscillators coupled to a thermal environment and found that both orders allowed practical estimation with a few dozen iterations. The variance was relatively small compared to the linear unraveling and did not grow with time. The second-order solver delivers much higher accuracy and stability with bigger time steps than the first-order scheme, with a small additional workload. However, the second-order algorithm has quadratic complexity with the number of Lindblad operators as opposed to the linear complexity of the first-order algorithm.",

Recently, crowdshipping has attracted increased attention as a new alternative to traditional delivery modes. In crowdshipping, private citizens (\"the crowd\") perform short detours in their daily lives to contribute to parcel delivery in exchange for small incentives. However, achieving desirable crowd behavior is challenging as the crowd is highly dynamic and consists of autonomous, self-interested individuals. Leveraging crowdshipping for time-sensitive deliveries remains an open challenge. In this paper, we present an agent-based approach to on-time parcel delivery with crowds. Our system performs data stream processing on the couriers' smartphone sensor data to predict delivery delays. Whenever a delay is predicted, the system attempts to forge an agreement for transferring the parcel from the current deliverer to a more promising courier nearby. Our experiments show that through accurate delay predictions and purposeful task transfers many delays can be prevented that would occur without our approach.",

However, dynamically adjusting their position to offer favorable communication channels introduces operational challenges in terms of energy consumption, especially when integrating advanced communication technologies like reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and full-duplex relays (FDRs). To this end, by recognizing the pivotal role of UAV mobility, the paper introduces an energy-aware trajectory design for UAV-mounted RISs and UAV-mounted FDRs using the decode and forward (DF) protocol, aiming to maximize the network minimum rate and enhance user fairness, while taking into consideration the available on-board energy. Specifically, this work highlights their distinct energy consumption characteristics and their associated integration challenges by developing appropriate energy consumption models for both UAV-mounted RISs and FDRs that capture the intricate relationship between key factors such as weight, and their operational characteristics. Furthermore, a joint time-division multiple access (TDMA) user scheduling-UAV trajectory optimization problem is formulated, considering the power dynamics of both systems, while assuring that the UAV energy is not depleted mid-air. Finally, simulation results underscore the importance of energy considerations in determining the optimal trajectory and scheduling and provide insights into the performance comparison of UAV-mounted RISs and FDRs in UAV-assisted wireless networks.",

        "abstract": "In a modern DBMS, working memory is frequently the limiting factor when processing in-memory analytic query operations such as joins, sorting, and aggregation. Existing resource estimation approaches for a DBMS estimate the resource consumption of a query by computing an estimate of each individual database operator in the query execution plan. Such an approach is slow and error-prone as it relies upon simplifying assumptions, such as uniformity and independence of the underlying data. Additionally, the existing approach focuses on individual queries separately and does not factor in other queries in the workload that may be executed concurrently. In this research, we are interested in query performance optimization under concurrent execution of a batch of queries (a workload). Specifically, we focus on predicting the memory demand for a workload rather than providing separate estimates for each query within it. We introduce the problem of workload memory prediction and formalize it as a distribution regression problem. We propose Learned Workload Memory Prediction (LearnedWMP) to improve and simplify estimating the working memory demands of workloads. Through a comprehensive experimental evaluation, we show that LearnedWMP reduces the memory estimation error of the state-of-the-practice method by up to 47.6%. Compared to an alternative single-query model, during training and inferencing, the LearnedWMP model and its variants were 3x to 10x faster. Moreover, LearnedWMP-based models were at least 50% smaller in most cases. Overall, the results demonstrate the advantages of the LearnedWMP approach and its potential for a broader impact on query performance optimization.",

However, the understanding of the dynamics of ICL and the aspects that influence downstream performance remains limited, especially for natural language generation (NLG) tasks. This work aims to address this gap by investigating the ICL capabilities of LLMs and studying the impact of different aspects of the in-context demonstrations for the task of machine translation (MT). Our preliminary investigations aim to discern whether in-context learning (ICL) is predominantly influenced by demonstrations or instructions by applying diverse perturbations to in-context demonstrations while preserving the task instruction. We observe varying behavior to perturbed examples across different model families, notably with BLOOM-7B derivatives being severely influenced by noise, whereas Llama 2 derivatives not only exhibit robustness but also tend to show enhancements over the clean baseline when subject to perturbed demonstrations. This suggests that the robustness of ICL may be governed by several factors, including the type of noise, perturbation direction (source or target), the extent of pretraining of the specific model, and fine-tuning for downstream tasks if applicable. Further investigation is warranted to develop a comprehensive understanding of these factors in future research.",

Smart contracts are programs written in specialized programming languages running on blockchains that govern how tokens and cryptocurrency are sent and received. Smart contracts can invoke other smart contracts during the execution of transactions always initiated by external users.\n  Once deployed, smart contracts cannot be modified, so techniques like runtime verification are very appealing for improving their reliability. However, the conventional model of computation of smart contracts is transactional: once operations commit, their effects are permanent and cannot be undone.\n  In this paper, we proposed the concept of future monitors which allows monitors to remain waiting for future transactions to occur before committing or aborting. This is inspired by optimistic rollups, which are modern blockchain implementations that increase efficiency (and reduce cost) by delaying transaction effects. We exploit this delay to propose a model of computation that allows (bounded) future monitors. We show our monitors correct respect of legacy transactions, how they implement future bounded monitors and how they guarantee progress. We illustrate the use of future bounded monitors to implement correctly multi-transaction flash loans.",

        "abstract": "The eigenvalue problem, a cornerstone in linear algebra, provides profound insights into studying matrix properties. Quantum algorithms addressing this problem have hitherto been constrained to special normal matrices assuming spectral decomposition, leaving the extension to general matrices an open challenge. In this work, we present a novel family of quantum algorithms tailored for solving the eigenvalue problem for general matrices, encompassing scenarios with complex eigenvalues or even defective matrices. Our approach begins by tackling the task of searching for an eigenvalue without additional constraints. For diagonalizable matrices, our algorithm has $\\tilde O(\\varepsilon^{-1})$ complexity with an error $\\varepsilon$, achieving the nearly Heisenberg scaling. Subsequently, we study the identification of eigenvalues closest to a specified point or line, extending the results for ground energy and energy gap problems in Hermitian matrices. We achieve an accuracy scaling of $\\tilde O(\\varepsilon^{-2})$ for general diagonalizable matrices, further refining to $\\tilde O(\\varepsilon^{-1})$ under the condition of real eigenvalues or constant distance from the reference point. The algorithm's foundation lies in the synergy of three techniques: the relationship between eigenvalues of matrix $A$ and the minimum singular value of $A-\u03bcI$, quantum singular value threshold subroutine extended from quantum singular-value estimation, and problem-specific searching algorithms. Our algorithms find applications in diverse domains, including estimating the relaxation time of Markov chains, solving Liouvillian gaps in open quantum systems, and verifying PT-symmetry broken/unbroken phases. These applications underscore the significance of our quantum eigensolvers for problems across various disciplines.",

However, the performance of ICL varies significantly with the choice of demonstrations, and it is still unclear why this happens or what factors will influence its choice. In this work, we first revisit the factors contributing to this variance from both data and model aspects, and find that the choice of demonstration is both data- and model-dependent. We further proposed a data- and model-dependent demonstration selection method, \\textbf{TopK + ConE}, based on the assumption that \\textit{the performance of a demonstration positively correlates with its contribution to the model's understanding of the test samples}, resulting in a simple and effective recipe for ICL. Empirically, our method yields consistent improvements in both language understanding and generation tasks with different model scales. Further analyses confirm that, besides the generality and stability under different circumstances, our method provides a unified explanation for the effectiveness of previous methods.

Motivated by the promising results of Best-of-N sampling strategies in language model training, we extend their application to reward model training. This results in a self-training strategy to generate preference pairs by selecting the best and worst candidates in a pool of responses to a given query. Empirically, we find that this approach improves the performance of any reward model, with an effect comparable to the addition of a similar quantity of human preference data.

        "abstract": "In this paper, the problem of using one active unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and four passive UAVs to localize a 3D target UAV in real time is investigated. In the considered model, each passive UAV receives reflection signals from the target UAV, which are initially transmitted by the active UAV. The received reflection signals allow each passive UAV to estimate the signal transmission distance which will be transmitted to a base station (BS) for the estimation of the position of the target UAV. Due to the movement of the target UAV, each active/passive UAV must optimize its trajectory to continuously localize the target UAV. Meanwhile, since the accuracy of the distance estimation depends on the signal-to-noise ratio of the transmission signals, the active UAV must optimize its transmit power. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to jointly optimize the transmit power of the active UAV and trajectories of both active and passive UAVs so as to maximize the target UAV positioning accuracy. To solve this problem, a Z function decomposition based reinforcement learning (ZD-RL) method is proposed. Compared to value function decomposition based RL (VD-RL), the proposed method can find the probability distribution of the sum of future rewards to accurately estimate the expected value of the sum of future rewards thus finding better transmit power of the active UAV and trajectories for both active and passive UAVs and improving target UAV positioning accuracy. Simulation results show that the proposed ZD-RL method can reduce the positioning errors by up to 39.4% and 64.6%, compared to VD-RL and independent deep RL methods, respectively.",

These models, benefiting from their advanced natural language understanding capabilities, have demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance. However, the pre-training data utilized in LLMs is often confined to a specific corpus, resulting in inherent freshness and temporal scope limitations. Consequently, this raises concerns regarding the effectiveness of LLMs for tasks involving temporal intents. In this study, we aim to investigate the underlying limitations of general-purpose LLMs when deployed for tasks that require a temporal understanding. We pay particular attention to handling factual temporal knowledge through three popular temporal QA datasets. Specifically, we observe low performance on detailed questions about the past and, surprisingly, for rather new information. In manual and automatic testing, we find multiple temporal errors and characterize the conditions under which QA performance deteriorates. Our analysis contributes to understanding LLM limitations and offers valuable insights into developing future models that can better cater to the demands of temporally-oriented tasks.

We discovered that the iCub robot was perceived as more humanlike than the Pepper robot when mirroring affect.

When dealing with textual requirements (i.e., requirements expressed using natural language), relation extraction becomes a cognitively challenging task, especially in terms of ambiguity and required effort from domain-experts. Hence, in highly-adaptive, large-scale environments, effective and efficient automated relation extraction using natural language processing techniques becomes essential.  In this chapter, we present a comprehensive overview of natural language-based relation extraction from text-based requirements. We initially describe the fundamentals of requirements relations based on the most relevant literature in the field, including the most common requirements relations types. The core of the chapter is composed by two main sections: (i) natural language techniques for the identification and categorization of requirements relations (i.e., syntactic vs. semantic techniques), and (ii) information extraction methods for the task of relation extraction (i.e., retrieval-based vs. machine learning-based methods). We complement this analysis with the state-of-the-art challenges and the envisioned future research directions. Overall, this chapter aims at providing a clear perspective on the theoretical and practical fundamentals in the field of natural language-based relation extraction.",

To develop the method, first, a database of semi-automatically labelled cerebellum lobules was created to train the proposed method with ultra-high resolution T1 and T2 MR images. Then, an ensemble of deep networks has been designed and developed, allowing the proposed method to excel in the complex cerebellum lobule segmentation task, improving precision while being memory efficient. Notably, our approach deviates from the traditional U-Net model by exploring alternative architectures. We have also integrated deep learning with classical machine learning methods incorporating a priori knowledge from multi-atlas segmentation, which improved precision and robustness. Finally, a new online pipeline, named DeepCERES, has been developed to make available the proposed method to the scientific community requiring as input only a single T1 MR image at standard resolution.",

The infrastructure resources are provided by the Infrastructure Manager, who analyses and assesses the bids received, allocating the resources to each Railway Undertaking. Time slot allocation is a fact that drastically influences the market equilibrium. In this paper, we address the time slot allocation problem within the context of a liberalized passenger railway market as a multi-objective model. The Infrastructure Manager is tasked with selecting a point from the Pareto front as the solution to the time slot allocation problem. We propose two criteria for making this selection: the first one allocates time slots to each company according to a set of priorities, while the second one introduces a criterion of fairness in the treatment of companies to incentive competition. The assessment of the impact of these rules on market equilibrium has been conducted on a liberalized high-speed corridor within the Spanish railway network.",

We utilized the Universal Dependencies dataset consisting of dependency treebanks from more than 100 languages, including Javanese. We propose two learning strategies to train the model: transfer learning (TL) and hierarchical transfer learning (HTL). While TL only uses a source language to pre-train the model, the HTL method uses a source language and an intermediate language in the learning process. The results show that our best model uses the HTL method, which improves performance with an increase of 10% for both UAS and LAS evaluations compared to the baseline model.",

It is capable of spotting machine text from a range of modern LLMs without any model-specific modifications.

The model-specific TreeSHAP methodology solves the exponential complexity for retrieving exact SVs from tree-based models. Expanding beyond individual feature attribution, Shapley interactions reveal the impact of intricate feature interactions of any order. In this work, we present TreeSHAP-IQ, an efficient method to compute any-order additive Shapley interactions for predictions of tree-based models. TreeSHAP-IQ is supported by a mathematical framework that exploits polynomial arithmetic to compute the interaction scores in a single recursive traversal of the tree, akin to Linear TreeSHAP. We apply TreeSHAP-IQ on state-of-the-art tree ensembles and explore interactions on well-established benchmark datasets.",

Such a model is useful when memory and compute are limited and singing voice processing has to run with limited look-ahead. In practice, this is realised by adapting an existing mono model to handle stereo input. Improvements in quality are obtained by tuning model parameters and expanding the training set. Moreover, we highlight the benefits a stereo model brings by introducing a new metric which detects attenuation inconsistencies between channels.

Nonfungible token (NFT) charity fundraisers, which involve the sale of NFTs of artistic works with the proceeds donated to philanthropic causes, have emerged as a novel development in this space. A unique aspect of NFT charity fundraisers is the significant potential for donors to reap financial gains from the rising value of purchased NFTs. Questions may arise about the motivations of donors in these charity fundraisers, resulting in a negative social image. NFT charity fundraisers thus offer a unique opportunity to understand the economic consequences of a donor's social image. We investigate these effects in the context of a large NFT charity fundraiser. We identify the causal effect of purchasing an NFT within the charity fundraiser on a donor's later market outcomes by leveraging random variation in transaction processing times on the blockchain. Further, we demonstrate a clear pattern of heterogeneity, based on an individual's decision to relist (versus hold) the purchased charity NFTs (a sign of strategic generosity), and based on an individual's degree of social exposure within the NFT marketplace. We show that charity-NFT \"relisters\" experience significant penalties in the market, in terms of the prices they are able to command on other NFT listings, particularly among those who relist quickly and those who are more socially exposed. Our study underscores the growing importance of digital visibility and traceability, features that characterize crypto-philanthropy, and online philanthropy more broadly.",

Identifying those security bug reports (SBRs) may help us predict some security-related bugs and solve security issues promptly so that the project can avoid threats and attacks. However, in the real world, the ratio of security bug reports is severely low; thus, directly training a prediction model with raw data may result in inaccurate results. Faced with the massive challenge of data imbalance, many researchers in the past have attempted to use text filtering or clustering methods to minimize the proportion of non-security bug reports (NSBRs) or apply oversampling methods to synthesize SBRs to make the dataset as balanced as possible. Nevertheless, there are still two challenges to those methods: 1) They ignore long-distance contextual information. 2) They fail to generate an utterly balanced dataset. To tackle these two challenges, we propose SEDAC, a new SBR identification method that generates similar bug report vectors to solve data imbalance problems and accurately detect security bug reports. Unlike previous studies, it first converts bug reports into individual bug report vectors with distilBERT, which are based on word2vec. Then, it trains a generative model through conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE) to generate similar vectors with security labels, which makes the number of SBRs equal to NSBRs'. Finally, balanced data are used to train a security bug report classifier. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we conduct it on 45,940 bug reports from Chromium and four Apache projects. The experimental results show that SEDAC outperforms all the baselines in g-measure with improvements of around 14.24%-50.10%.",

Our bound translates to a lower bound of $\u03a9(\\sqrt{d})$ on the number of training examples required for standard GD to reach a non-trivial test error, answering an open question raised by Feldman (2016) and Amir, Koren, and Livni (2021b) and showing that a non-trivial dimension dependence is unavoidable. Furthermore, for standard one-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD), we show that an application of the same construction technique provides a similar $\u03a9(\\sqrt{d})$ lower bound for the sample complexity of SGD to reach a non-trivial empirical error, despite achieving optimal test performance. This again provides an exponential improvement in the dimension dependence compared to previous work (Koren, Livni, Mansour, and Sherman, 2022), resolving an open question left therein.",

Additionally, we propose CloSe-Net, the first learning-based 3D clothing segmentation model for fine-grained segmentation from colored point clouds. CloSe-Net uses local point features, body-clothing correlation, and a garment-class and point features-based attention module, improving performance over baselines and prior work. The proposed attention module enables our model to learn appearance and geometry-dependent clothing prior from data. We further validate the efficacy of our approach by successfully segmenting publicly available datasets of people in clothing.

The key idea is to first use audio-visual cues to select a set of high-precision audio exemplars for each character, and then use these exemplars to classify all speech segments by speaker identity. Notably, the method does not require face detection or tracking. We evaluate the method over a variety of TV sitcoms, including Seinfeld, Fraiser and Scrubs. We envision this system being useful for the automatic generation of subtitles to improve the accessibility of the vast amount of videos available on modern streaming services.

While significant generalization improvements and thus reduction of overfitting could be demonstrated, the computational costs are doubled due to the additionally needed gradient calculation, making SAM unfeasible in case of limited computationally capacities. Motivated by Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) we propose Momentum-SAM (MSAM), which perturbs parameters in the direction of the accumulated momentum vector to achieve low sharpness without significant computational overhead or memory demands over SGD or Adam.

In this paper we tackle a more subtle challenge: doctors take a targeted medical history to obtain only the most pertinent pieces of information; how do we enable AI to do the same? We develop a wrapper method named MINT (Make your model INTeractive) that automatically determines what pieces of information are most valuable at each step, and ask for only the most useful information. We demonstrate the efficacy of MINT wrapping a skin disease prediction model, where multiple images and a set of optional answers to $25$ standard metadata questions (i.e., structured medical history) are used by a multi-modal deep network to provide a differential diagnosis. We show that MINT can identify whether metadata inputs are needed and if so, which question to ask next. We also demonstrate that when collecting multiple images, MINT can identify if an additional image would be beneficial, and if so, which type of image to capture. We showed that MINT reduces the number of metadata and image inputs needed by 82% and 36.2% respectively, while maintaining predictive performance. Using real-world AI dermatology system data, we show that needing fewer inputs can retain users that may otherwise fail to complete the system submission and drop off without a diagnosis. Qualitative examples show MINT can closely mimic the step-by-step decision making process of a clinical workflow and how this is different for straight forward cases versus more difficult, ambiguous cases. Finally we demonstrate how MINT is robust to different underlying multi-model classifiers and can be easily adapted to user requirements without significant model re-training.",

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of recent advances in mathematical optimization theory and algorithms for wireless communication system design. We begin by illustrating common features of mathematical optimization problems arising in wireless communication system design. We discuss various scenarios and use cases and their associated mathematical structures from an optimization perspective. We then provide an overview of recent advances in mathematical optimization theory and algorithms, from nonconvex optimization, global optimization, and integer programming, to distributed optimization and learning-based optimization. The key to successful solution of mathematical optimization problems is in carefully choosing and/or developing suitable optimization algorithms (or neural network architectures) that can exploit the underlying problem structure.

Nevertheless, much of the earlier work in merging these two sensory modalities has relied on supervised methods utilizing datasets labeled by humans.This paper introduces MViTac, a novel methodology that leverages contrastive learning to integrate vision and touch sensations in a self-supervised fashion. By availing both sensory inputs, MViTac leverages intra and inter-modality losses for learning representations, resulting in enhanced material property classification and more adept grasping prediction. Through a series of experiments, we showcase the effectiveness of our method and its superiority over existing state-of-the-art self-supervised and supervised techniques. In evaluating our methodology, we focus on two distinct tasks: material classification and grasping success prediction.

An increase in walking speed resulted in a corresponding decrease in raindrop and snowflake collisions. When raindrops or snowflakes were given a horizontal movement vector due to wind, a local minimum in collisions was achieved when moving in parallel with the same horizontal speed as the raindrop; no local minimum was detected with antiparallel movement.

However, the learning-based stereo-confidence networks should be trained with ground truth (GT), which is not feasible in a self-supervised setting. In this paper, we propose a method to identify and filter errors in the pseudo-depth map using multiple disparity maps by checking their consistency without the need for GT and a training process. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the previous methods and works well on various configurations by filtering out erroneous areas where the stereo-matching is vulnerable, especially such as textureless regions, occlusion boundaries, and reflective surfaces.",

It is important to investigate the robustness of compressed networks in two types of data distribution shifts: domain shifts and adversarial perturbations. In this study, we discover that compressed models are less robust to distribution shifts than their original networks. Interestingly, larger networks are more vulnerable to losing robustness than smaller ones, even when they are compressed to a similar size as the smaller networks. Furthermore, compact networks obtained by knowledge distillation are much more robust to distribution shifts than pruned networks. Finally, post-training quantization is a reliable method for achieving significant robustness to distribution shifts, and it outperforms both pruned and distilled models in terms of robustness.",

In federated learning, a central server periodically coordinates models with clients and aggregates the models trained locally by clients without necessitating access to local data. Despite its potential, the implementation of federated learning continues to encounter several challenges, predominantly the slow convergence that is largely due to data heterogeneity. The slow convergence becomes particularly problematic in cross-device federated learning scenarios where clients may be strongly limited by computing power and storage space, and hence counteracting methods that induce additional computation or memory cost on the client side such as auxiliary objective terms and larger training iterations can be impractical. In this paper, we propose a novel federated aggregation strategy, TurboSVM-FL, that poses no additional computation burden on the client side and can significantly accelerate convergence for federated classification task, especially when clients are \"lazy\" and train their models solely for few epochs for next global aggregation. TurboSVM-FL extensively utilizes support vector machine to conduct selective aggregation and max-margin spread-out regularization on class embeddings. We evaluate TurboSVM-FL on multiple datasets including FEMNIST, CelebA, and Shakespeare using user-independent validation with non-iid data distribution. Our results show that TurboSVM-FL can significantly outperform existing popular algorithms on convergence rate and reduce communication rounds while delivering better test metrics including accuracy, F1 score, and MCC.",

Its backing of data-intensive architecture descriptions empowers with an automated generation for data quality checks. Result - The Framework offers a comprehensive solution for data-intensive applications to model their architecture efficiently and monitor the quality of their data.

In contrast to classical network interdiction models where the leader is subject to a single budget constraint, in our setting, both the leader and the follower are subject to several independent cardinality constraints and engage in a zero-sum game. While a single-level linear integer programming problem over a partition matroid is known to be polynomially solvable, we prove that the considered bilevel problem is NP-hard, even when the objective function coefficients are all binary. On a positive note, it turns out that, if the number of cardinality constraints is fixed for either the leader or the follower, then the considered class of bilevel problems admits several polynomial-time solution schemes. Specifically, these schemes are based on a single-level dual reformulation, a dynamic programming-based approach, and a 2-flip local search algorithm for the leader.",

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently gained growing attention in graph learning and have shown significant improvements in many important graph problems. Despite their state-of-the-art performances, existing GNNs only use local information from a very limited neighborhood around each node, suffering from loss of multi-modal information and overheads of excessive computation. To address these issues, we propose a novel Tensor-view Topological Graph Neural Network (TTG-NN), a class of simple yet effective topological deep learning built upon persistent homology, graph convolution, and tensor operations. This new method incorporates tensor learning to simultaneously capture Tensor-view Topological (TT), as well as Tensor-view Graph (TG) structural information on both local and global levels. Computationally, to fully exploit graph topology and structure, we propose two flexible TT and TG representation learning modules that disentangle feature tensor aggregation and transformation and learn to preserve multi-modal structure with less computation. Theoretically, we derive high probability bounds on both the out-of-sample and in-sample mean squared approximation errors for our proposed Tensor Transformation Layer (TTL). Real data experiments show that the proposed TTG-NN outperforms 20 state-of-the-art methods on various graph benchmarks.",

We propose a Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient (NLCG) optimizer for model-based T2/T1 estimation, which incorporates U-Net regularization trained in a scan-specific manner. This end-to-end method directly estimates qMRI maps from undersampled k-space data using mono-exponential signal modeling with zero-shot scan-specific neural network regularization to enable high fidelity T1 and T2 mapping. T2 and T1 mapping results demonstrate the ability of the proposed NLCG-Net to improve estimation quality compared to subspace reconstruction at high accelerations.",

        "abstract": "Anemia is a prevalent medical condition that typically requires invasive blood tests for diagnosis and monitoring. Electronic health records (EHRs) have emerged as valuable data sources for numerous medical studies. EHR-based hemoglobin level/anemia degree prediction is non-invasive and rapid but still faces some challenges due to the fact that EHR data is typically an irregular multivariate time series containing a significant number of missing values and irregular time intervals. To address these issues, we introduce HgbNet, a machine learning-based prediction model that emulates clinicians' decision-making processes for hemoglobin level/anemia degree prediction. The model incorporates a NanDense layer with a missing indicator to handle missing values and employs attention mechanisms to account for both local irregularity and global irregularity. We evaluate the proposed method using two real-world datasets across two use cases. In our first use case, we predict hemoglobin level/anemia degree at moment T+1 by utilizing records from moments prior to T+1. In our second use case, we integrate all historical records with additional selected test results at moment T+1 to predict hemoglobin level/anemia degree at the same moment, T+1. HgbNet outperforms the best baseline results across all datasets and use cases. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of estimating hemoglobin levels and anemia degree from EHR data, positioning HgbNet as an effective non-invasive anemia diagnosis solution that could potentially enhance the quality of life for millions of affected individuals worldwide. To our knowledge, HgbNet is the first machine learning model leveraging EHR data for hemoglobin level/anemia degree prediction.",

Grounded in the foundational concepts of disparity definition and the disparity plane sweep, the proposed stereo-confidence method is built upon the idea that any shift in a stereo-image pair should be updated in a corresponding amount shift in the disparity map. Based on this idea, the proposed stereo-confidence method can be summarized in three folds. 1) Using the disparity plane sweep, multiple disparity maps can be obtained and treated as a 3-D volume (predicted disparity volume), like the cost volume is constructed. 2) One of these disparity maps serves as an anchor, allowing us to define a desirable (or ideal) disparity profile at every spatial point. 3) By comparing the desirable and predicted disparity profiles, we can quantify the level of matching ambiguity between left and right images for confidence measurement. Extensive experimental results using various stereo-matching networks and datasets demonstrate that the proposed stereo-confidence method not only shows competitive performance on its own but also consistent performance improvements when it is used as an input modality for learning-based stereo-confidence methods.",

Actionable patterns must meet rigorous statistical significance criteria and, in the presence of target variables, further uphold discriminative power. Our work addresses the underexplored area of guiding pattern discovery by integrating statistical significance and discriminative power criteria into state-of-the-art algorithms while preserving pattern quality. We also address how pattern quality thresholds, imposed by some algorithms, can be rectified to accommodate these additional criteria. To test the proposed methodology, we select the triclustering task as the guiding pattern discovery case and extend well-known greedy and multi-objective optimization triclustering algorithms, $\u03b4$-Trimax and TriGen, that use various pattern quality criteria, such as Mean Squared Residual (MSR), Least Squared Lines (LSL), and Multi Slope Measure (MSL). Results from three case studies show the role of the proposed methodology in discovering patterns with pronounced improvements of discriminative power and statistical significance without quality deterioration, highlighting its importance in supervisedly guiding the search. Although the proposed methodology is motivated over multivariate time series data, it can be straightforwardly extended to pattern discovery tasks involving multivariate, N-way (N>3), transactional, and sequential data structures.\n  Availability: The code is freely available at https://github.com/JupitersMight/MOF_Triclustering under the MIT license.",

We develop a rather general framework that helps in establishing tight lower bounds for various tree verification problems. We also consider two different verification requirements: namely that every node detects in the case the input is incorrect, as well as the requirement that at least one node detects. The results are stronger than previous ones in the sense that we assume that each node knows the number $n$ of nodes in the graph (in some cases) or an $\u03b1$ approximation of $n$ (in other cases). For spanning tree verification, we show that the message complexity inherently depends on the quality of the given approximation of $n$: We show a tight lower bound of $\u03a9(n^2)$ for the case $\u03b1\\ge \\sqrt{2}$ and a much better upper bound (i.e., $O(n \\log n)$) when nodes are given a tighter approximation. On the other hand, our framework also yields an $\u03a9(n^2)$ lower bound on the message complexity of verifying a minimum spanning tree (MST), which reveals a polynomial separation between ST verification and MST verification. This result holds for randomized algorithms with perfect knowledge of the network size, and even when just one node detects illegal inputs, thus improving over the work of Kor, Korman, and Peleg (2013). For verifying a $d$-approximate BFS tree, we show that the same lower bound holds even if nodes know $n$ exactly, however, the lower bound is sensitive to $d$, which is the stretch parameter.",

An added challenge is the dependency of the water quality dynamics on the system's hydraulics, which influences the performance of the water quality controller. Prior research has addressed either solving the optimum operational hydraulic setting problem or regulating the water quality dynamics as separate problems. Additionally, there have been efforts to couple these two problems and solve one compact problem resulting in trade-offs between the contradictory objectives. In contrast, this paper examines the dependency and influence from a control-theoretic standpoint. More specifically, we explore the influence of accountability for water quality controllability improvement when addressing the pump scheduling problem. We examine its effects on the cumulative cost of the interconnected systems as well as the subsequent performance of the water quality controller. To achieve this, we develop a framework that incorporates different controllability metrics within the operational hydraulic optimization problem; its aim is attaining an adequate level of water quality control across the system. We assess the aforementioned aspects' performance on various scaled networks with a wide range of numerical scenarios.",

However, most detection techniques rely on large external probes and antennas for data collection and require a long measurement time to detect Trojans. Such limitations make these techniques impractical for run-time deployment and ineffective in detecting small Trojans with subtle side-channel signatures. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Programmable Sensor Array (PSA) for run-time hardware Trojan detection, localization, and identification. PSA is a tampering-resilient integrated on-chip magnetic field sensor array that can be re-programmed to change the sensors' shape, size, and location. Using PSA, EM side-channel measurement results collected from sensors at different locations on an IC can be analyzed to localize and identify the Trojan. The PSA has better performance than conventional external magnetic probes and state-of-the-art on-chip single-coil magnetic field sensors. We fabricated an AES-128 test chip with four AES Hardware Trojans. They were successfully detected, located, and identified with the proposed on-chip PSA within 10 milliseconds using our proposed cross-domain analysis.",

The study focuses on anti-ISRJ techniques in the waveform domain, primarily capitalizing on waveform design and and anti-jamming signal processing methods in the waveform domain. By exploring the relationship between waveform-domain adaptive matched filtering (WD-AMF) output and waveform-domain signals, we demonstrate that ISRJ can be effectively suppressed when the transmitted waveform exhibits waveform-domain complementarity. We introduce a phase-coded (PC) waveform set with waveform-domain complementarity and propose a method for generating such waveform sets of arbitrary code lengths. The performance of WD-AMF are further developed due to the designed waveforms, and simulations affirm the superior adaptive anti-jamming capabilities of the designed waveforms compared to traditional ones. Remarkably, this improved performance is achieved without the need for prior knowledge of ISRJ interference parameters at either the transmitter or receiver stages.",

In the semantic encoder, we introduce a feature compression module based on the channel attention mechanism in CNNs, to compress intermediate data by selecting the most informative features. In the semantic decoder, we design a lightweight decoder to reconstruct the intermediate data through learning from the received compressed data to improve accuracy. To effectively trade-off communication, computation, and inference accuracy, we design a reward function and formulate the offloading problem of CNN inference as a maximization problem with the goal of maximizing the average inference accuracy and throughput over the long term. To address this maximization problem, we propose a graph reinforcement learning-based AECNN (GRL-AECNN) method, which outperforms existing works DROO-AECNN, GRL-BottleNet++ and GRL-DeepJSCC under different dynamic scenarios.

A generative adversarial network (GAN) training is usually required for these E2E neural codecs because of the difficulty of direct phase modeling. However, such adversarial learning hinders these codecs from preserving the original phase information. To achieve human-level naturalness with a reasonable bitrate, preserve the original phase, and get rid of the tricky and opaque GAN training, we develop a score-based diffusion post-filter (SPF) in the complex spectral domain and combine our previous AudioDec with the SPF to propose ScoreDec, which can be trained using only spectral and score-matching losses. Both the objective and subjective experimental results show that ScoreDec with a 24~kbps bitrate encodes and decodes full-band 48~kHz speech with human-level naturalness and well-preserved phase information.",

Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a potential solution for future heterogeneous networks (HetNets) due to its high capacity and spectrum efficiency. In this study, we analyze an uplink NOMA-enabled vehicular-aided HetNet, where multiple vehicular user equipment (VUEs) share the access link spectrum, and a high-altitude platform (HAP) communicates with roadside units (RSUs) through a backhaul communication link. We propose an improved algorithm for user association that selects VUEs for HAPs based on channel coefficient ratios and terrestrial VUEs based on a caching-state backhaul communication link. The joint optimization problems aim to maximize a utility function that considers VUE transmission rates and cross-tier interference while meeting the constraints of backhaul transmission rates and QoS requirements of each VUE. The joint resource allocation optimization problem consists of three sub-problems: bandwidth allocation, user association, and transmission power allocation. We derive a closed-form solution for bandwidth allocation and solve the transmission power allocation sub-problem iteratively using Taylor expansion to transform a non-convex term into a convex one. Our proposed three-stage iterative algorithm for resource allocation integrates all three sub-problems and is shown to be effective through simulation results. Specifically, the results demonstrate that our solution achieves performance improvements over existing approaches.",

Predicted logits were measured against ground truth labels of each patient's Extended Disability Severity Score (EDSS) using binary cross-entropy loss. Training/validation/holdout testing was partitioned using 5-fold cross validation with a total split of 60:20:20. Levene's test of variance was used to measure statistical difference and Student's t-test for paired model differences in mean. Results The MPS-LSTM, reverse MERA-LSTM, and TTN-LSTM had holdout testing ROC-AUC of 0.70, 0.77, and 0.81, respectively (p-value 0.915). VGG16-LSTM and ViViT performed similarly with ROC-AUC of 0.73 and 0.77, respectively (p-value 0.631). Overall variance and mean were not statistically significant (p-value 0.713), however, time to train was significantly faster for the QCNN-LSTMs (39.4 sec per fold vs. 224 and 218, respectively, p-value <0.001). Conclusion QCNN-LSTM models perform competitively to their classical counterparts with greater efficiency in train time. Clinically, these can add value in terms of efficiency to time-dependent deep learning prediction of disease progression based upon medical imaging.",

However, dynamically adjusting their position to offer favorable communication channels introduces operational challenges in terms of energy consumption, especially when integrating advanced communication technologies like reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and full-duplex relays (FDRs). To this end, by recognizing the pivotal role of UAV mobility, the paper introduces an energy-aware trajectory design for UAV-mounted RISs and UAV-mounted FDRs using the decode and forward (DF) protocol, aiming to maximize the network minimum rate and enhance user fairness, while taking into consideration the available on-board energy. Specifically, this work highlights their distinct energy consumption characteristics and their associated integration challenges by developing appropriate energy consumption models for both UAV-mounted RISs and FDRs that capture the intricate relationship between key factors such as weight, and their operational characteristics. Furthermore, a joint time-division multiple access (TDMA) user scheduling-UAV trajectory optimization problem is formulated, considering the power dynamics of both systems, while assuring that the UAV energy is not depleted mid-air. Finally, simulation results underscore the importance of energy considerations in determining the optimal trajectory and scheduling and provide insights into the performance comparison of UAV-mounted RISs and FDRs in UAV-assisted wireless networks.",

To develop the method, first, a database of semi-automatically labelled cerebellum lobules was created to train the proposed method with ultra-high resolution T1 and T2 MR images. Then, an ensemble of deep networks has been designed and developed, allowing the proposed method to excel in the complex cerebellum lobule segmentation task, improving precision while being memory efficient. Notably, our approach deviates from the traditional U-Net model by exploring alternative architectures. We have also integrated deep learning with classical machine learning methods incorporating a priori knowledge from multi-atlas segmentation, which improved precision and robustness.

We explore how to achieve performance similar to large state-of-the-art source separation networks starting from a small, efficient model for real-time speech separation. Such a model is useful when memory and compute are limited and singing voice processing has to run with limited look-ahead. In practice, this is realised by adapting an existing mono model to handle stereo input. Improvements in quality are obtained by tuning model parameters and expanding the training set. Moreover, we highlight the benefits a stereo model brings by introducing a new metric which detects attenuation inconsistencies between channels.

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of recent advances in mathematical optimization theory and algorithms for wireless communication system design. We begin by illustrating common features of mathematical optimization problems arising in wireless communication system design. We discuss various scenarios and use cases and their associated mathematical structures from an optimization perspective. We then provide an overview of recent advances in mathematical optimization theory and algorithms, from nonconvex optimization, global optimization, and integer programming, to distributed optimization and learning-based optimization. The key to successful solution of mathematical optimization problems is in carefully choosing and/or developing suitable optimization algorithms (or neural network architectures) that can exploit the underlying problem structure.

To overcome this, we introduce a novel system, XXX, optimized for such devices. XXX is built on the insight that speech understanding primarily relies on understanding the entire utterance's long-term dependencies, while privacy concerns are often linked to short-term details. Therefore, XXX focuses on selectively masking these short-term elements, preserving the quality of long-term speech understanding. The core of XXX is an innovative differential mask generator, grounded in interpretable learning, which fine-tunes the masking process. We tested XXX on the STM32H7 microcontroller, assessing its performance in various potential attack scenarios. The results show that XXX maintains speech understanding accuracy and privacy at levels comparable to existing encoders, but with a significant improvement in efficiency, achieving up to 53.3$\\times$ faster processing and a 134.1$\\times$ smaller memory footprint.",

In this study, we introduce a novel approach to address safety concerns by transforming safety conditions into control constraints with a relative degree of 1. This transformation is facilitated through the design of control barrier functions, enabling the creation of a safety control system for affine nonlinear networks. Subsequently, we formulate a robust control strategy that incorporates safety protocols and conduct a comprehensive analysis of its stability and reliability. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply it to a specific problem involving adaptive cruise control.

Previous methods based on deep learning treat downscaling as a super-resolution task in computer vision and utilize high-resolution gridded meteorological fields as supervision to improve resolution at specific grid scales. However, this approach has struggled to align with the continuous distribution characteristics of meteorological fields, leading to an inherent systematic bias between the downscaled results and the actual observations at meteorological stations. In this paper, we extend meteorological downscaling to arbitrary scattered station scales, establish a brand new benchmark and dataset, and retrieve meteorological states at any given station location from a coarse-resolution meteorological field. Inspired by data assimilation techniques, we integrate observational data into the downscaling process, providing multi-scale observational priors. Building on this foundation, we propose a new downscaling model based on hypernetwork architecture, namely HyperDS, which efficiently integrates different observational information into the model training, achieving continuous scale modeling of the meteorological field. Through extensive experiments, our proposed method outperforms other specially designed baseline models on multiple surface variables. Notably, the mean squared error (MSE) for wind speed and surface pressure improved by 67% and 19.5% compared to other methods. We will release the dataset and code subsequently.",

However, in multi-user orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, RIS may not be as promising as in single-carrier systems since an independent optimization of RIS elements at each sub-carrier is impossible in multi-carrier systems. Thus, this paper investigates the performance of various RIS technologies like regular (reflective and passive), simultaneously transmit and reflect (STAR), and multi-sector beyond diagonal (BD) RIS in multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) OFDM broadcast channels (BC). This requires to formulate and solve a joint MIMO precoding and RIS optimization problem. The obtained solution reveals that RIS can significantly improve the system performance even when the number of RIS elements is relatively low. Moreover, we develop resource allocation schemes for STAR-RIS and multi-sector BD-RIS in MIMO OFDM BCs, and show that these RIS technologies can outperform a regular RIS, especially when the regular RIS cannot assist the communications for all the users.",

        "abstract": "Recently, Differentiable Ray Tracing has been successfully applied in the field of wireless communications for learning radio materials or optimizing the transmitter orientation. However, in the frame of gradient based optimization, obstruction of the rays by objects can cause sudden variations in the related objective functions or create entire regions where the gradient is zero. As these issues can dramatically impact convergence, this paper presents a novel Ray Tracing framework that is fully differentiable with respect to any scene parameter, but also provides a loss function continuous everywhere, thanks to specific local smoothing techniques. Previously non-continuous functions are replaced by a smoothing function, that can be exchanged with any function having similar properties. This function is also configurable via a parameter that determines how smooth the approximation should be. The present method is applied on a basic one-transmitter-multi-receiver scenario, and shows that it can successfully find the optimal solution. As a complementary resource, a 2D Python library, DiffeRT2d, is provided in Open Access, with examples and a comprehensive documentation.",

        "abstract": "This study presents a comprehensive overview of PIML techniques in the context of condition monitoring. The central concept driving PIML is the incorporation of known physical laws and constraints into machine learning algorithms, enabling them to learn from available data while remaining consistent with physical principles. Through fusing domain knowledge with data-driven learning, PIML methods offer enhanced accuracy and interpretability in comparison to purely data-driven approaches. In this comprehensive survey, detailed examinations are performed with regard to the methodology by which known physical principles are integrated within machine learning frameworks, as well as their suitability for specific tasks within condition monitoring. Incorporation of physical knowledge into the ML model may be realized in a variety of methods, with each having its unique advantages and drawbacks. The distinct advantages and limitations of each methodology for the integration of physics within data-driven models are detailed, considering factors such as computational efficiency, model interpretability, and generalizability to different systems in condition monitoring and fault detection. Several case studies and works of literature utilizing this emerging concept are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of PIML in condition monitoring applications. From the literature reviewed, the versatility and potential of PIML in condition monitoring may be demonstrated. Novel PIML methods offer an innovative solution for addressing the complexities of condition monitoring and associated challenges. This comprehensive survey helps form the foundation for future work in the field. As the technology continues to advance, PIML is expected to play a crucial role in enhancing maintenance strategies, system reliability, and overall operational efficiency in engineering systems.",

        "abstract": "Given the broad application of infrared technology across diverse fields, there is an increasing emphasis on investigating super-resolution techniques for infrared images within the realm of deep learning. Despite the impressive results of current Transformer-based methods in image super-resolution tasks, their reliance on the self-attentive mechanism intrinsic to the Transformer architecture results in images being treated as one-dimensional sequences, thereby neglecting their inherent two-dimensional structure. Moreover, infrared images exhibit a uniform pixel distribution and a limited gradient range, posing challenges for the model to capture effective feature information. Consequently, we suggest a potent Transformer model, termed Large Kernel Transformer (LKFormer), to address this issue. Specifically, we have designed a Large Kernel Residual Depth-wise Convolutional Attention (LKRDA) module with linear complexity. This mainly employs depth-wise convolution with large kernels to execute non-local feature modeling, thereby substituting the standard self-attentive layer. Additionally, we have devised a novel feed-forward network structure called Gated-Pixel Feed-Forward Network (GPFN) to augment the LKFormer's capacity to manage the information flow within the network. Comprehensive experimental results reveal that our method surpasses the most advanced techniques available, using fewer parameters and yielding considerably superior performance.",

In this regard, we propose a speaker protection method based on adversarial attacks. The proposed method perturbs speech signals by minimally altering the original speech while rendering downstream speech generation models unable to accurately generate the voice of the target speaker. For validation, we employ the open-source pre-trained YourTTS model for speech generation and protect the target speaker's speech in the white-box scenario. Automatic speaker verification (ASV) evaluations were carried out on the generated speech as the assessment of the voice protection capability. Our experimental results show that we successfully perturbed the speaker encoder of the YourTTS model using the gradient-based I-FGSM adversarial perturbation method. Furthermore, the adversarial perturbation is effective in preventing the YourTTS model from generating the speech of the target speaker.

Deep learning has emerged as the predominant solution for automated segmentation of volumetric medical images. 2.5D-based segmentation models bridge computational efficiency of 2D-based models and spatial perception capabilities of 3D-based models. However, prevailing 2.5D-based models often treat each slice equally, failing to effectively learn and exploit inter-slice information, resulting in suboptimal segmentation performances. In this paper, a novel Momentum encoder-based inter-slice fusion transformer (MOSformer) is proposed to overcome this issue by leveraging inter-slice information at multi-scale feature maps extracted by different encoders. Specifically, dual encoders are employed to enhance feature distinguishability among different slices. One of the encoders is moving-averaged to maintain the consistency of slice representations. Moreover, an IF-Swin transformer module is developed to fuse inter-slice multi-scale features. The MOSformer is evaluated on three benchmark datasets (Synapse, ACDC, and AMOS), establishing a new state-of-the-art with 85.63%, 92.19%, and 85.43% of DSC, respectively. These promising results indicate its competitiveness in medical image segmentation. Codes and models of MOSformer will be made publicly available upon acceptance.",

Unlike existing works that assume all data sources to be accessible by a single trusted party, we explicitly address data privacy concerns that arise in the collaboration and data sharing between multiple data owners, such as municipal authorities (MAs) and mobility providers (MPs). To this end, we propose a novel vertical federated learning (FL) approach, FedTSE, that enables multiple data owners to collaboratively train and apply a TSE model without having to exchange their private data. To enhance the applicability of the proposed FedTSE in common TSE scenarios with limited availability of ground-truth data, we further propose a privacy-preserving physics-informed FL approach, i.e., FedTSE-PI, that integrates traffic models into FL. Real-world data validation shows that the proposed methods can protect privacy while yielding similar accuracy to the oracle method without privacy considerations.",

A perceptual listening test demonstrates that ASD volunteers attained lower intelligibility rates than Neurotypical (NT).

The fundamental frequency are estimated by the HHT-Amp technique. Harmonic patterns estimated with low accuracy are detected and adjusted according the FSFFE low/high pitch separation. The central frequencies of the filterbank are defined considering the third octave subbands which are best suited to cover the regions most relevant to intelligibility. Before signal reconstruction, the gammachirp filtered components are amplified by gain factors regulated by FSFFE classification. The proposed HDAG solution and three baseline techniques are examined considering six background noises with four signal-to-noise ratios. Three objective measures are adopted for the evaluation of speech intelligibility and quality. Several experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves better speech intelligibility improvement when compared to the competing approaches.

In particular, a single-antenna source sends information to a FA reader through the wireless forward (i.e., source-to-tag) and backscatter (tag-to-reader) channels. For the considered BC, we first derive the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the equivalent channel at the FA receiver, and then we obtain closed-form expressions of the outage probability (OP) and delay outage rate (DOR) under a correlated Rayleigh distribution. Moreover, in order to gain more insights into the system performance, we present analytical expressions of the OP and DOR at the high SNR regime. Numerical results indicate that considering the FA at the reader can significantly improve the performance of BC in terms of the OP and DOR compared with a single-antenna reader.",

In the design phase, this is achieved through co-simulation of component models. However, complex co-simulation environments are rarely (re-)used in the verification and validation phases, in which mixed real-virtual prototypes (e.g. Hardware-in-the-Loop) are already available. One reason for this are coupling errors such as time-delays, which inevitably occur in co-simulation of virtual and real-time systems, and which influence system behavior in an unknown and generally detrimental way. This contribution introduces a novel, adaptive method to compensate for constant time-delays in potentially highly nonlinear, spatially distributed mixed real-virtual prototypes, using small feedforward neural networks. Their optimal initialization with respect to defined frequency domain features results from a-priori frequency domain analysis of the entire coupled system, including coupling faults and compensation methods. A linear and a nonlinear example demonstrate the method and emphasize its suitability for nonlinear systems due to online training and adaptation. As the compensation method requires knowledge only of the bandwidths, the proposed method is applicable to distributed mixed real-virtual prototypes in general.",

Speaker verification system trained on a varied set of speakers to achieve optimal generalization performance without relying on transcriptions. Synthesizer is trained using both audio and transcriptions that generate Mel spectrogram from a text and vocoder which converts the generated Mel Spectrogram into corresponding audio signal. Then the audio signal is processed by a noise reduction algorithm to eliminate unwanted noise and enhance speech clarity. The performance of synthesized speech from seen and unseen speakers are then evaluated using subjective and objective evaluation such as Mean Opinion Score (MOS), Gross Pitch Error (GPE), and Spectral distortion (SD).

The experiment focused on drilling around critical structures following cortical mastoidectomy, utilizing dental stone phantom and cadaveric models. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed haptic feedback mechanism enhances the safety of drilling around critical structures compared to systems lacking haptic assistance. With the aid of our system, surgeons were able to safely skeletonize the critical structures without breaching any critical structure even under obstructed view of the surgical site.",

To distil the teacher's knowledge, we use an attention decoder that learns from BERT's token probabilities. Our method shows that language model (LM) information can be more effectively distilled into an ASR model using both the intermediate layers and the final layer. By using the intermediate layers as distillation target, we can more effectively distil LM knowledge into the lower network layers. Using our method, we achieve better recognition accuracy than with shallow fusion of an external LM, allowing us to maintain fast parallel decoding. Experiments on the LibriSpeech dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing greedy decoding with connectionist temporal classification (CTC).",

To describe the effects of stochastic channels on the information transmission, the transmission times are assumed to be deterministic, whereas the packet transmission is assumed to be random. We first propose a stochastic scheduling protocol to model random packet dropouts, and address the properties of the proposed stochastic scheduling protocol. The proposed scheduling protocol provides a unified modelling framework for a general class of random packet dropouts due to different stochastic channels. Next, the proposed scheduling protocol is embedded into the closed-loop system, which leads to a stochastic hybrid model for NCSs with random packet dropouts. Based on this stochastic hybrid model, we follow the emulation approach to establish sufficient conditions to guarantee uniform global asymptotical stability in probability. In particular, an upper bound on the maximally allowable transmission interval is derived explicitly for all stochastic protocols satisfying Lyapunov conditions that guarantee uniform global asymptotic stability in probability. Finally, two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the derived results.",

As can be known, the current fusion methods based on Transformer techniques for infrared and visible (IV) images have exhibited promising performance. However, the attention mechanism of the previous Transformer-based methods was prone to extract common information from source images without considering the discrepancy information, which limited fusion performance. In this paper, by reevaluating the cross-attention mechanism, we propose an alternate Transformer fusion network (ATFuse) to fuse IV images. Our ATFuse consists of one discrepancy information injection module (DIIM) and two alternate common information injection modules (ACIIM). The DIIM is designed by modifying the vanilla cross-attention mechanism, which can promote the extraction of the discrepancy information of the source images. Meanwhile, the ACIIM is devised by alternately using the vanilla cross-attention mechanism, which can fully mine common information and integrate long dependencies. Moreover, the successful training of ATFuse is facilitated by a proposed segmented pixel loss function, which provides a good trade-off for texture detail and salient structure preservation. The qualitative and quantitative results on public datasets indicate our ATFFuse is effective and superior compared to other state-of-the-art methods.",

The results of the experiments illustrate that RTA-Former achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in five polyp segmentation datasets.

In this work, we propose a novel bilingual end-to-end (E2E) modeling approach, where a single neural model can recognize both languages and also support switching between the languages, without any language input from the user. The proposed model has shared encoder and prediction networks, with language-specific joint networks that are combined via a self-attention mechanism. As the language-specific posteriors are combined, it produces a single posterior probability over all the output symbols, enabling a single beam search decoding and also allowing dynamic switching between the languages. The proposed approach outperforms the conventional bilingual baseline with 13.3%, 8.23% and 1.3% word error rate relative reduction on Hindi, English and code-mixed test sets, respectively.",

This study investigated the transformative impact of emerging technologies on the design and structure of optical network architectures, including spectrally efficient multicarrier systems and bandwidth-variable wavelength-selective switches. A cost-effective ROADM architecture applying an order-based connecting approach was introduced, which presented a high connectivity level and a blockage probability of less than 10-4. When this architecture was implemented in the EON, the data transportation rate was 1 Tb/s. This outcome successfully accommodated a 20 % surge in traffic demand, while the optimized network architecture significantly improved fiber utilization by 3.4 %. Consequently, this study contributed a practical and efficient solution for implementing flexible optical networks, effectively addressing current concerns and propelling the optical communication system sector forward.",

Despite the simplification inherent in this reformulated problem, our agent demonstrates performance that is at least on par with established methods. This assertion is validated by testing it across standard datasets associated with D4RL Gym-MuJoCo tasks. We further discuss the agent's ability to generalize by testing it on two extreme cases, how it learns to model the return distributions effectively even with highly skewed expert datasets, and how it exhibits robust performance in scenarios with sparse/delayed rewards.",

In this paper, we extend the applications of the framework NORTH to problems with a hybrid of continuous and discrete variables. This is achieved in a coordinate-descent method, where the continuous and discrete variables are optimized separately during iterations.

As seen, CLIC expands the receptive field into the entire image for intra-cluster feature aggregation. Afterward, features are reordered to their original spatial positions to pass through the local attention units for inter-cluster embedding. Additionally, we introduce the Guided Post-Quantization Filtering (GuidedPQF) into CLIC, effectively mitigating the propagation and accumulation of quantization errors at the initial decoding stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of CLIC over state-of-the-art works: when optimized using MSE, it outperforms VVC by about 10% BD-Rate in three widely-used benchmark datasets; when optimized using MS-SSIM, it saves more than 50% BD-Rate over VVC. Our CLIC offers a new way to generate compact representations for image compression, which also provides a novel direction along the line of LIC development.",

In this paper, we consider deterministic problem settings in which the targets of interest are known a priori. We propose a novel integer linear programming formulation for MCRP, capable of obtaining provably optimal solutions. To overcome computational intractability due to the combinatorial explosion in solving large-scale instances, we introduce two computationally efficient sequential decision-making methods based on the principles of a myopic policy and a rolling horizon procedure. The computational experiments demonstrate that the devised sequential decision-making approaches yield high-quality solutions with improved computational efficiency over the baseline MCRP.

Since industrial systems become more and more complex, more research about the maintenance of systems with heterogeneous components is needed. For this reason, in this paper, a system consisting of two groups of components: degrading and non-degrading components is analyzed. The main novelty of this paper is the evaluation of a maintenance policy at system-level coordinating condition-based maintenance for the degrading components, delay time to the maintenance and an inspection strategy for this heterogeneous system. To that end, an analytic cost model is built using the semi-regenerative processes theory. Furthermore, a safety constraint related to the reliability of the degrading components is imposed.

Approaches for dealing with under-actuation due to magnetic control torque's dependency on the magnetic field and required high magnetic flux densities have been previously considered. Generally speaking, control of a satellite that becomes under-actuated as a result of on-board failures has been a recurrent theme in the literature. Methods for controlling spacecraft with fewer actuators than degrees of freedom are increasingly in demand due to the increased number of small satellite launches. Magnetic torquers have been extensively investigated for momentum management of spacecraft with momentum wheels and for nutation damping of spin satellites, momentum-biased, and dual-spin satellites. Nonetheless, severely under-actuated small spacecraft that carry only a single-axis magnetic torquer have not been previously treated. This note considers the detumbling of a small spacecraft using only a single-axis magnetic torquer. Even with a three-axis magnetic torquer, the spacecraft is under-actuated, while, in the case of only a single axis magnetic torquer, the problem is considerably more demanding. Our note examines the feasibility of spacecraft attitude control with a single-axis magnetic torquer and possible control methods that can be used.",

Although magnetorquers are generally used with other actuators, such as momentum wheels, this paper explores a control method where only a magnetic actuation is available. We applied a nonlinear optimal control method, Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC), to small satellites, employing the generalized minimal residual (GMRES) method, which generates continuous control inputs. Onboard magnetic actuation systems often find it challenging to produce smooth magnetic moments as a control input; hence, we employ the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) method, which discretizes a control input and reduces the burden on actuators. In our case, the PWM approach discretizes control torques generated by the NMPC scheme. This study's main contributions are investigating the NMPC and the GMRES method applied to small spacecraft and presenting the PWM control system's feasibility.",

        "abstract": "Forest wildfires represent one of the catastrophic events that, over the last decades, caused huge environmental and humanitarian damages. In addition to a significant amount of carbon dioxide emission, they are a source of risk to society in both short-term (e.g., temporary city evacuation due to fire) and long-term (e.g., higher risks of landslides) cases. Consequently, the availability of tools to support local authorities in automatically identifying burned areas plays an important role in the continuous monitoring requirement to alleviate the aftereffects of such catastrophic events. The great availability of satellite acquisitions coupled with computer vision techniques represents an important step in developing such tools. This paper introduces a novel open dataset that tackles the burned area delineation problem, a binary segmentation problem applied to satellite imagery. The presented resource consists of pre- and post-fire Sentinel-2 L2A acquisitions of California forest fires that took place starting in 2015. Raster annotations were generated from the data released by California's Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Moreover, in conjunction with the dataset, we release three different baselines based on spectral indexes analyses, SegFormer, and U-Net models.",

We propose a novel framework that employs fine-tuned LLMs to interpret natural language commands and convert them into specific operational instructions for EHD pump control. This approach aims to enhance user interaction with complex hardware systems, making it more intuitive and efficient. The methodology involves four key steps: fine-tuning the language model with a dataset of color specifications and corresponding Arduino code, developing a natural language processing interface, translating user inputs into executable Arduino code, and controlling EHD pumps for accurate color mixing. Conceptual experiment results, based on theoretical assumptions, indicate a high potential for accurate color synthesis, efficient language model interpretation, and reliable EHD pump operation. This research extends the application of LLMs beyond text-based tasks, demonstrating their potential in industrial automation and control systems.

One key solution element is an intermediate model layer which first reconstructs the bh curve and then estimates the power losses based on the curve's area rendering the proposed topology physically interpretable. In addition, emphasis was placed on expert-based feature engineering and information-rich inputs in order to enable a lean model architecture. A model is trained from scratch for each material, while the topology remains the same. A Pareto-style trade-off between model size and estimation accuracy is demonstrated, which yields an optimum at as low as 1755 parameters and down to below 8\\,\\% for the 95-th percentile of the relative error for the worst-case material with sufficient samples.",

Different from traditional road-based modeling schemes, a two-lane intersection model is first proposed to model the flow propagation in a more accurate way. A distributed model predictive control (MPC) method is then presented to assign the green times. To enable the real-time feasibility of the proposed approach, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is incorporated with the distributed MPC scheme for solving the problem.

The tendency of modern-day Deep Neural networks to make overconfident mistakes limit their usage to detect cancer. In this paper, we propose a new task-specific loss function to calibrate the neural network to reduce the risk of overconfident mistakes. We use the state-of-the-art Multi-class Difference in Confidence and Accuracy (MDCA) loss in conjunction with the proposed task-specific loss function to achieve the same. We also integrate post-hoc calibration by performing temperature scaling on top of the train-time calibrated model.

However, the energy consumption (EC) characteristic of sensor nodes is a key factor that affects the operational performance (e.g., lifetime of sensors) and the total cost of ownership of WSNs. In this paper, to find the modulation techniques suitable for WSNs, we investigate the EC characteristic of continuous phase modulation (CPM), which is an attractive modulation scheme candidate for WSNs because of its constant envelope property. We first develop an EC model for the sensor nodes of WSNs by considering the circuits and a typical communication protocol that relies on automatic repeat request (ARQ)-based retransmissions to ensure successful data delivery. Then, we use this model to analyze the EC characteristic of CPM under various configurations of modulation parameters. Furthermore, we compare the EC characteristic of CPM with that of other representative modulation schemes, such as offset quadrature phase-shift keying (OQPSK) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), which are commonly used in communication protocols of WSNs. Our analysis and simulation results provide insights into the EC characteristics of multiple modulation schemes in the context of WSNs; thus, they are beneficial for designing energy-efficient SG-IoT in the beyond-5G (B5G) and the 6G era.",

Subsequently, a motion planning module is developed to guide the landing process, formulating it as a minimum jerk trajectory by applying the differential flatness property. Considering visibility and dynamic constraints, the problem is solved using quadratic programming, and the final motion primitive is expressed through piecewise polynomials. Through a series of experiments, the applicability of this approach is validated by successfully landing 18 cm x 18 cm quadrotor on a 43 cm x 43 cm platform, exhibiting performance comparable to conventional methods.

Especially within the Internet of Things (IoT), the knowledge of position information for individual components is of great interest, for example, in asset tracking, to name just one. However, many of these use cases require a high energy efficiency, making a GNSS-based approach infeasible. One promising candidate can be found in Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN), which enable battery lifetimes of up to 20 years. However, no gold standard for localization exists for these types of networks. Our work proposes a testbed architecture that allows the investigation and development of localization algorithms within LPWA Networks. The concept is built on a Cloud Radio Access Network (CRAN) architecture that allows the streaming of IQ from remote base stations to a central processing unit. Furthermore, the architecture is expanded by a synchronization concept based on Signals of Opportunity (SoO) to enable the testbed for runtime-based positioning. Therefore, we propose a hardware concept consisting of antennas and a low-cost off-the-shelf software-defined radio (SDR)-based frontend architecture and a software framework using a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)-based server and client architecture. The proposed system is installed in an urban environment. Initial measurements are conducted, where it can be shown that the proposed architecture can be used for highly precise Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) measurements, offering the possibility of time synchronization down to approximately 200 ps and frequency synchronization of 3 mHz.",

To tackle the non-convex optimization problem, we adopt an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, in which two phase shift optimization techniques are developed to handle the unit-modulus constraints induced by the reflection coefficients at the RIS.

Leveraging the ample bandwidth in the terahertz (THz) spectrum, in this paper, we propose MEC-enabled integrated SAG networks with collaboration among unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We then formulate the problem of minimizing the energy consumption of devices and UAVs in the proposed MEC-enabled integrated SAG networks by optimizing tasks offloading decisions, THz sub-bands assignment, transmit power control, and UAVs deployment. The formulated problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MILP) problem with a non-convex structure, which is challenging to solve. We thus propose a block coordinate descent (BCD) approach to decompose the problem into four sub-problems: 1) device task offloading decision problem, 2) THz sub-band assignment and power control problem, 3) UAV deployment problem, and 4) UAV task offloading decision problem. We then propose to use a matching game, concave-convex procedure (CCP) method, successive convex approximation (SCA), and block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM) approaches for solving the individual subproblems. Finally, extensive simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Utilization of inter-base station cooperation for information processing has shown great potential in enhancing the overall quality of communication services (QoS) in wireless communication networks. Nevertheless, such cooperations require the knowledge of channel state information (CSI) at base stations (BSs), which is assumed to be perfectly known. However, CSI errors are inevitable in practice which necessitates beamforming techniques that can achieve robust performance in the presence of channel estimation errors. Existing approaches relax the robust beamforming design problems into semidefinite programming (SDP), which can only achieve a solution that is far from being optimal. To this end, this paper views robust beamforming design problems from a bilevel optimization perspective. In particular, we focus on maximizing the worst-case weighted sum-rate (WSR) in the downlink multi-cell multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) system considering bounded CSI errors. We first reformulate this problem into a bilevel optimization problem and then develop an efficient algorithm based on the cutting plane method. A distributed optimization algorithm has also been developed to facilitate the parallel processing in practical settings. Numerical results are provided to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of performance and complexity, particularly in the presence of CSI uncertainties.",

The approach rests on the development of scalar counterparts to the original vector systems. We show that the solutions to these scalar auxiliary nonlinear equations with delay and variable coefficients bound from the above the norms of solutions to the original equations with the matched history functions. This prompts the assessment of the boundedness/stability traits of the vector systems through the abridged evaluation of the dynamics of their scalar counterparts. The latter task is achieved in effortless simulations or through the application of simplified analytical inferences. Consequently, we convey some novel boundedness/ stability criteria and estimate the radiuses of the balls imbedded in the boundedness/stability regions. Lastly, we authenticate our inferences in representative simulations that also measure their accuracy.",

In such networks, edge devices will offload their computational tasks to an MEC server, using the energy they harvest from this server. To get their tasks processed on time using the harvested energy, edge devices will strategically schedule their task offloading, and compete for the computational resource at the MEC server. Then, the MEC server will execute these tasks asynchronously based on the arrival of the tasks. This joint user scheduling, time and computation resource allocation problem is posed as an optimization framework whose goal is to find the optimal scheduling and allocation strategy that minimizes the energy consumption of these mobile computing tasks. To solve this mixed-integer non-linear programming problem, the general benders decomposition method is adopted which decomposes the original problem into a primal problem and a master problem. Specifically, the primal problem is related to computation resource and time slot allocation, of which the optimal closed-form solution is obtained. The master problem regarding discrete user scheduling variables is constructed by adding optimality cuts or feasibility cuts according to whether the primal problem is feasible, which is a standard mixed-integer linear programming problem and can be efficiently solved. By iteratively solving the primal problem and master problem, the optimal scheduling and resource allocation scheme is obtained. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed asynchronous computing framework reduces 87.17% energy consumption compared with conventional synchronous computing counterpart.",

To address this issue, we propose a novel self-supervised contrastive learning-based approach for hybrid beamforming, which is robust against imperfect CSI.

System-level autonomy establishes situational awareness that resolves conflicting information across subsystems, which may necessitate the refinement and interconnection of the underlying spacecraft and environment onboard models. However, with a limited understanding of the assumptions and tradeoffs of modeling to arbitrary extents, designing onboard models to support system-level capabilities presents a significant challenge.\n  In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of the increasing levels of model fidelity for several key spacecraft subsystems, with the goal of informing future spacecraft functional- and system-level autonomy algorithms and the physics-based simulators on which they are validated. We do not argue for the adoption of a particular fidelity class of models but, instead, highlight the potential tradeoffs and opportunities associated with the use of models for onboard autonomy and in physics-based simulators at various fidelity levels. We ground our analysis in the context of deep space exploration of small bodies, an emerging frontier for autonomous spacecraft operation in space, where the choice of models employed onboard the spacecraft may determine mission success. We conduct our experiments in the Multi-Spacecraft Concept and Autonomy Tool (MuSCAT), a software suite for developing spacecraft autonomy algorithms.",

Modern software systems are often so sophisticated that their complexity exceeds the limits of human comprehension. These systems must respond to changing goals, dynamic data, unexpected failures, and security threats, among other variable factors in real-world environments. Systems' complexity challenges their interpretability and requires autonomous responses to dynamic changes. Two main research areas explore autonomous systems' responses: evolutionary computing and autonomic computing. Evolutionary computing focuses on software improvement based on iterative modifications to the source code. Autonomic computing focuses on optimising systems' performance by changing their structure, behaviour, or environment variables. Approaches from both areas rely on feedback loops that accumulate knowledge from the system interactions to inform autonomous decision-making. However, this knowledge is often limited, constraining the systems' interpretability and adaptability. This paper proposes a new concept for interpretable and adaptable software systems: self-sustaining software systems (S4). S4 builds knowledge loops between all available knowledge sources that define modern software systems to improve their interpretability and adaptability.

Our study embarks on a comparative analysis of G-IOSVB against the traditional IOSVB and the exhaustive Singular-Vector Beamspace Search (SVBS) algorithms. The findings reveal that while SVBS achieves the highest SE, it incurs significant computational costs, approximately 162 seconds per channel realization. In contrast, G-IOSVB aligns closely with IOSVB in SE performance yet is markedly more computationally efficient. Heatmaps vividly demonstrate this efficiency, highlighting G-IOSVB's reduced computation time without sacrificing SE. We also delve into the mathematical intricacies of G-IOSVB, demonstrating its theoretical and practical superiority through rigorous expressions and detailed algorithmic analysis. The numerical results illustrate that G-IOSVB stands out as an efficient, practical solution for MU-MIMO systems, making it a promising candidate for high-speed, high-efficiency wireless communication networks.",

While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated potential in managing complex nonlinear dynamics; its trial-and-error nature limits its application to problems involving computationally demanding environmental interactions. This study introduces a cutting-edge off-policy DRL algorithm, interacting with a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) environment to acquire intricate fin-ray control strategies tailored for various propulsive performance objectives. To enhance training efficiency and enable scalable parallelism, an innovative asynchronous parallel training (APT) strategy is proposed, which fully decouples FSI environment interactions and policy/value network optimization. The results demonstrated the success of the proposed method in discovering optimal complex policies for fin-ray actuation control, resulting in a superior propulsive performance compared to the optimal sinusoidal actuation function identified through a parametric grid search. The merit and effectiveness of the APT approach are also showcased through comprehensive comparison with conventional DRL training strategies in numerical experiments of controlling nonlinear dynamics.",

Thus, the operational state of the system (top layer) depends on the states of the modules (middle layer), which in turn depend on the states of their components (bottom layer). This allows a detailed description of the system operation to plan maintenance actions appropriately and optimally. We propose a hierarchical decision-based maintenance strategy with periodic inspections as follows: at the time of the inspection, the condition of the system is first evaluated. If intervention is necessary, the modules are then checked to make individual decisions based on their states, and so on. Replacement or repair will be carried out as appropriate. An optimization problem is formulated as a function of the length of the inspection period and the intervention cost incurred over the useful life of the system. Our method shows the advantages, providing compact and implementable expressions. The model is illustrated on a submarine Electrical Control Unit (ECU).",

The classification uncertainty of each region is then evaluated. Those areas with the lowest uncertainties are then chosen to be weakly labeled segmentation seeds, at the pixel level, for the second part of the framework. Each of the seed extents are progressively resized according to an unsupervised, information-theoretic loss with structured-prediction regularizers. This reshaping process uses multi-scale, adaptively-weighted features to delineate class-specific transitions in local image content. Content-addressable memories are inserted at various parts of our framework so that it can leverage features from previously seen images to improve segmentation performance for related images.\n  We evaluate our weakly-supervised framework using real-world CSAS imagery that contains over ten seafloor classes and ten target classes. We show that our framework performs comparably to nine fully-supervised deep networks. Our framework also outperforms eleven of the best weakly-supervised deep networks. We achieve state-of-the-art performance when pre-training on natural imagery.

Although, there exist many feature selection methods, however, these methods face challenges such as scalability, managing high-dimensional data, dealing with correlated features, adapting to variable feature importance, and integrating domain knowledge. To this end, we introduce the ``Adaptive Feature Selection with Binary Masking\" (AFS-BM) which remedies these problems. AFS-BM achieves this by joint optimization for simultaneous feature selection and model training. In particular, we do the joint optimization and binary masking to continuously adapt the set of features and model parameters during the training process. This approach leads to significant improvements in model accuracy and a reduction in computational requirements. We provide an extensive set of experiments where we compare AFS-BM with the established feature selection methods using well-known datasets from real-life competitions. Our results show that AFS-BM makes significant improvement in terms of accuracy and requires significantly less computational complexity. This is due to AFS-BM's ability to dynamically adjust to the changing importance of features during the training process, which an important contribution to the field. We openly share our code for the replicability of our results and to facilitate further research.",

In light of the grave consequences that such attacks could cause, we explore four models from the U-Net family and examine their responses to the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) attack. We conduct FGSM attacks on each of them and experiment with various schemes to conduct the attacks. In this paper, we find that medical imaging segmentation models are indeed vulnerable to adversarial attacks and that there is a negligible correlation between parameter size and adversarial attack success. Furthermore, we show that using a different loss function than the one used for training yields higher adversarial attack success, contrary to what the FGSM authors suggested. In future efforts, we will conduct the experiments detailed in this paper with more segmentation models and different attacks. We will also attempt to find ways to counteract the attacks by using model ensembles or special data augmentations. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhongxuanWang/adv_attk",

It is considered one of the most promising methods for enabling the Internet of Nano-Things (IoNT) and nanonetworks. BioFETs are commonly used to implement practical MC receivers.

This paper introduces the first FinFET-based MC receiver that covers both the top and side gates with receptors. Both binding noise and flicker noise are considered in the analysis.

RDARS encompasses DAS and RIS as two special cases and maintains the advantages of distributed antennas while reducing the hardware cost by replacing some active antennas with low-cost passive reflecting surfaces. In this paper, we present a RDARS-aided uplink multi-user communication system and investigate the system transmission reliability with the newly proposed architecture. Specifically, in addition to the distribution gain and the reflection gain provided by the connection and reflection modes, respectively, we also consider the dynamic mode switching of each element which introduces an additional degree of freedom (DoF) and thus results in a selection gain. As such, we aim to minimize the total sum mean-square-error (MSE) of all data streams by jointly optimizing the receive beamforming matrix, the reflection phase shifts and the channel-aware placement of elements in the connection mode. To tackle this nonconvex problem with intractable binary and cardinality constraints, we propose an inexact block coordinate descent (BCD) based penalty dual decomposition (PDD) algorithm with the guaranteed convergence. Since the PDD algorithm usually suffers from high computational complexity, a low-complexity greedy-search-based alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is developed to yield a semi-closed-form solution with acceptable performance. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed architecture compared to the conventional fully passive RIS or DAS. Furthermore, some insights about the practical implementation of RDARS are provided.",

The generative function operates by \"backing up\" through the FFNN. The PBN is two networks in one, a FFNN that operates in the forward direction, and a generative network that operates in the backward direction. Both networks co-exist based on the same parameter set, have their own cost functions, and can be separately or jointly trained. The PBN therefore has the potential to possess the best qualities of both discriminative and generative classifiers. To realize this potential, a separate PBN is trained on each class, maximizing the generative likelihood function for the given class, while minimizing the discriminative cost for the FFNN against \"all other classes\". This technique, called discriminative alignment (PBN-DA), aligns the contours of the likelihood function to the decision boundaries and attains vastly improved classification performance, rivaling that of state of the art discriminative networks. The method may be further improved using a hidden Markov model (HMM) as a component of the PBN, called PBN-DA-HMM. This paper provides a comprehensive treatment of PBN, PBN-DA, and PBN-DA-HMM. In addition, the results of two new classification experiments are provided. The first experiment uses air-acoustic events, and the second uses underwater acoustic data consisting of marine mammal calls. In both experiments, PBN-DA-HMM attains comparable or better performance as a state of the art CNN, and attain a factor of two error reduction when combined with the CNN.",

Conventional techniques involving machine learning based observers on systems evolving on Lie groups involve designing charts for the Lie group, training a machine learning based observer for each chart, and switching between the trained models based on the state of the system. We propose a novel deep learning based technique whose predictions are restricted to a measure 0 subset of Euclidean space without using charts. Using this network, we design an observer ensuring that the state of the observer is restricted to the Lie group, and predicting the state using only one trained algorithm. The deep learning network predicts an ``error term'' on the Lie algebra of the Lie group, uses the map from the Lie algebra to the group, and uses the group action and the present state to estimate the state at the next epoch. This model being purely data driven does not require the model of the system. The proposed algorithm provides a novel framework for constraining the output of machine learning networks to a measure 0 subset of a Euclidean space without chart specific training and without requiring switching. We show the validity of this method using Monte Carlo simulations performed of the rigid body rotation and translation system.",

By considering both the near field and far field, a triple-refined hybrid-field beam training scheme is proposed, where high-accuracy estimates of channel parameters are obtained through three steps of progressive beam refinement. First, the hybrid-field beam gain (HFBG)-based first refinement method is developed. Based on the analysis of the HFBG, the first-refinement codebook is designed and the beam training is performed accordingly to narrow down the potential region of the channel path. Then, the maximum likelihood (ML)-based and principle of stationary phase (PSP)-based second refinement methods are developed. By exploiting the measurements of the beam training, the ML is used to estimate the channel parameters. To avoid the high computational complexity of ML, closed-form estimates of the channel parameters are derived according to the PSP. Moreover, the Gaussian approximation (GA)-based third refinement method is developed. The hybrid-field neighboring search is first performed to identify the potential region of the main lobe of the channel steering vector. Afterwards, by applying the GA, a least-squares estimator is developed to obtain the high-accuracy channel parameter estimation. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

We propose a measurement bias estimator for such systems under assumption of boundedness of angular velocity. We also provide continuous estimates to the state of the system, i.e. the pose, linear velocity, and position of the body. These estimates are globally exponentially convergent to the state of the rigid body system. We propose two bias estimators designed with the estimate of the pose in the ambient Euclidean space of the Special Euclidean group and show global exponential convergence of the proposed observers to the state of the system. The first observer assumes knowledge of bounds of the angular velocity, while the second observer uses a Riccati observer to overcome this limitation. We show the convergence with an example of a rigid body rotation and translation system on the special Euclidean group. We show that the observer is able to estimate the bias using data collected from an Intel Realsense camera.",

The usual approach to counteract ASV systems against such attacks is to develop a separate spoofing countermeasure (CM) module to classify speech input either as a bonafide, or a spoofed utterance. Nevertheless, such a design requires additional computation and utilization efforts at the authentication stage. An alternative strategy involves a single monolithic ASV system designed to handle both zero-effort imposter (non-targets) and spoofing attacks. Such spoof-aware ASV systems have the potential to provide stronger protections and more economic computations. To this end, we propose to generalize the standalone ASV (G-SASV) against spoofing attacks, where we leverage limited training data from CM to enhance a simple backend in the embedding space, without the involvement of a separate CM module during the test (authentication) phase. We propose a novel yet simple backend classifier based on deep neural networks and conduct the study via domain adaptation and multi-task integration of spoof embeddings at the training stage. Experiments are conducted on the ASVspoof 2019 logical access dataset, where we improve the performance of statistical ASV backends on the joint (bonafide and spoofed) and spoofed conditions by a maximum of 36.2% and 49.8% in terms of equal error rates, respectively.",

A variety of longitudinal control strategies for CAVs have been developed to enhance traffic efficiency, stability, and safety in mixed-autonomy scenarios. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is one promising strategy for mixed-autonomy platoon control since it can tackle complex scenarios in real-time. However, there are three research gaps for DRL-based mixed-autonomy platoon control. First, incorporating safety considerations into DRL typically relies on designing collision avoidance-based reward functions, which lack collision-free guarantees. Second, current DRL-based-control approaches for mixed traffic only consider the safety of CAVs, with little attention paid to the surrounding HDVs. To address the research gaps, we introduce a differentiable safety layer that converts DRL actions into safe actions with collision-free guarantees. This process relies on solving a differentiable quadratic programming problem that incorporates control barrier function-based (CBF) safety constraints for both CAV and its following HDVs to achieve system-level safety. Moreover, constructing CBF constraints needs system dynamics for the following HDVs, and thus we employ an online system identification module to estimate the car-following dynamics of the surrounding HDVs. The proposed safe reinforcement learning approach explicitly integrates system-level safety constraints into the training process and enables our method to adapt to varying safety-critical scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method effectively ensures CAV safety and improves HDV safety in mixed platoon environments while simultaneously enhancing traffic capacity and string stability.",

To deal with the near-field double beam split effect, the base station is equipped with frequency-dependent hybrid precoding architecture by introducing sub-connected true time delay (TTD) units, while two specific RIS architectures, namely true time delay-based RIS (TTD-RIS) and virtual subarray-based RIS (SA-RIS), are exploited to realize the frequency-dependent passive beamforming at the RIS. Furthermore, the efficient E2E beamforming models without explicit channel state information are proposed, which jointly exploits the uplink channel training module and the downlink wideband beamforming module. In the proposed network architecture of the E2E models, the classical communication signal processing methods, i.e., polarized filtering and sparsity transform, are leveraged to develop a signal-guided beamforming network. Numerical results show that the proposed E2E models have superior beamforming performance and robustness to conventional beamforming benchmarks. Furthermore, the tradeoff between the beamforming gain and the hardware complexity is investigated for different frequency-dependent RIS architectures, in which the TTD-RIS can achieve better spectral efficiency than the SA-RIS while requiring additional energy consumption and hardware cost.",

        "abstract": "Conventional active array radars often jointly design the transmit and receive beamforming for effectively suppressing interferences. To further promote the interference suppression performance, this paper introduces a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to assist the radar receiver because the RIS has the ability to bring plentiful additional degrees-of-freedom. To maximize the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of receive array, we formulate the codesign of transmit beamforming and RIS-aided receive beamforming into a nonconvex constrained fractional programming problem, and then propose an alternating minimization-based algorithm to jointly optimize the transmit beamformer, receive beamformer and RIS reflection coefficients. Specifically, we offer the closed-form optimal solutions of transmit and receive beamformers according to the minimum variance distortionless response principle, and translate the RIS reflection coefficients design into a series of unimodular quadratic programming (UQP) subproblems by employing the Dinkelbach transform. To tackle the UQP subproblems efficiently, we propose a second-order Riemannian Newton method (RNM) with improved Riemannian Newton direction, which avoids the line search and has better convergence speed than typical first-order Riemannian manifold optimization methods. Moreover, we derive the convergence of the proposed codesign algorithm by deducing the explicit convergence condition of RNM. We also analyze the computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RIS-aided array radar has superior performance of interference suppression to the RIS-free one, and the SINR improvement is proportional to the number of RIS elements.",

Portable cuff BP devices, on the other hand, are cumbersome to carry all day and often cost-prohibitive in less developed countries. Besides, these sphygmomanometer-based devices can cause discomfort and disrupt blood flow during measurement. This study explores the use of smartphones for continuous BP monitoring, focusing on overcoming the trust barriers associated with the opacity of machine learning models in predicting BP from low-quality PPG signals. Our approach included developing models based on cardiovascular literature, using simple statistical methods to estimate BP from smartphone PPG signals with comprehensive data pre-processing, applying SHAP for enhanced interpretability and feature identification, and comparing our methods against standard references using Bland-Altman analysis. Validated with data from 125 participants, the study demonstrated significant correlations in waveform features between smartphone and reference BP monitoring devices. The cross-validation of linear regression [MAE=9.86 and 8.01 mmHg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), respectively] and random forest model (MAE=8.91 and 6.68 mmHg for SBP and DBP) using waveform-only variables demonstrated the feasibility of using a smartphone to estimate BP. Although SHAP analysis identified key feature sets, Bland-Altman results did not fully meet established thresholds (84.64% and 94.69% of MAE<15 mmHg for SBP and DBP, respectively). The study suggests the potential of smartphone cameras to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of machine learning models for daily BP estimation, but also indicates that smartphone PPG-based BP prediction is not yet a replacement for traditional medical devices.",

The data for weakly magnetic Fe$_2$VAl$_{1.35}$ are discussed in respect to Ni$_2$VAl. Fe$_2$VAl$_{1.35}$ can be classified as a nearly ferromagnetic metal with a pronounced spin glassy contribution, which, however, does not give a predominant effect on its thermoelectric properties. The figure of merit $ZT$ is at 300 K about 0.05 for the Fe sample and 0.02 for Ni one, respectively. However, it is documented that the narrow $d$ band resulting from Fe/V site exchange can be responsible for the unusual temperature dependencies of the physical properties of the Fe2TiAl$_{1.35}$ alloy, characteristic of strongly correlated electron systems. As an example, the magnetic susceptibility of Fe$_2$VAl$_{1.35}$ exhibits singularity characteristic of a Griffiths phase, appearing as an inhomogeneous electronic state below $T_G\\sim 200$ K. We also performed numerical analysis which supports the Griffiths phase scenario.",

We compare the bulk OBC spectra with the periodic boundary condition (PBC) spectra, pointing out that they do not coincide, which is an intrinsic characteristic of non-Hermitian systems. The non-Hermiticity thus results in the failure of the familiar notions of bulk-boundary correspondence found for Hermitian systems. This necessitates the search for topological invariants which can characterize gap-closings in open non-Hermitian systems correctly and unambiguously. We elucidate the behaviour of two possible candidates applicable for one-dimensional slices -- (1) the sum of winding numbers for the two bands defined on a generalized Brillouin zone and (2) the biorthogonal polarization (BP). While the former shows jumps/discontinuities for some of the non-Hermitian systems studied here, at points when an edge mode enters the bulk states and becomes delocalized, it does not maintain quantized values in a given topological phase. On the contrary, BP shows jumps and at phase transitions takes the quantized value of one or zero, which corresponds to whether an actual edge mode exists or whether that mode is delocalized and absorbed within the bulk (not being an edge mode anymore).",

The two layers function effectively as a sensory layer providing input to a hidden layer. The spin dynamics displayed by the bilayer are shown to be well described using a continuous form of the free energy principle that has been proposed as a high level description of certain biological neural processes.

From August-December 2023, the LONEStar team performed on-orbit calibration of the optical instrument and a number of different OPNAV experiments. This campaign included the processing of nearly 400 images of star fields, Earth and Moon, and four other planets (Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn). LONEStar provided the first on-orbit demonstrations of heliocentric navigation using only optical observations of planets.

To demonstrate, we apply a physically informed GNN (piGNN) to predict the motility of multicellular collectives from a snapshot of their positions both in experiments and simulations. We demonstrate that piGNN is capable of navigating through complex graph features of multicellular living systems, which otherwise can not be achieved by classical mechanistic models. With increasing amounts of multicellular data, we propose that collaborative efforts can be made to create a multicellular data bank (MDB) from which it is possible to construct a large multicellular graph model (LMGM) for general-purposed predictions of multicellular organization.",

We propose a novel methodology that combines spatial extreme-value theory with a machine learning (ML) algorithm to model weather extremes and quantify probabilities associated with the occurrence, intensity and spatial extent of these events. The model is here applied to Western European summertime heat extremes. Using new loss functions adapted to extreme values, we fit a theoretically-motivated spatial model to extreme positive temperature anomaly fields from 1959-2022, using the daily 500-hpa geopotential height fields across the Euro-Atlantic region and the local soil moisture as predictors. Our generative model reveals the importance of individual circulation features in determining different facets of heat extremes, thereby enriching our process understanding of them from a data-driven perspective. The occurrence, intensity, and spatial extent of heat extremes are sensitive to the relative position of individual ridges and troughs that are part of a large-scale wave pattern. Heat extremes in Europe are thus the result of a complex interplay between local and remote physical processes. Our approach is able to extrapolate beyond the range of the data to make risk-related probabilistic statements, and applies more generally to other weather extremes. It also offers an attractive alternative to physical model-based techniques, or to ML approaches that optimise scores focusing on predicting well the bulk instead of the tail of the data distribution.",

One can ask the same question about unitarity of quantum and inflationary cosmology. In this paper we argue that in both cases, for black holes and for cosmology, the answer is negative and we face non-unitarity.\n  Such a question can not be addressed by using the fixed classical gravitational background since one has to take into account the backreaction. To his end one uses the semi-classical gravity, which includes the expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor operator of the matter fields. One has to renormalize the energy-momentum tensor and one gets an effective action which contains quadratic terms in scalar curvature and Ricci tensor. Such quadratic gravity contains ghosts which in fact lead to violation of unitarity in black holes and cosmology. We discuss the question whether black holes will emit ghosts.\n  One can try to restrict ourselves to the $f(R)$ gravity that seems is a good approximation to the semi-classical gravity and widely used in cosmology. The black hole entropy in $f(R)$ gravity is different from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and from entanglement island entropy. The black hole entropy in $R+R^2$ gravity goes to a constant during the evaporation process. This can be interpreted as another indication to the possible non-unitarity in black holes and cosmology",

Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of the marine atmospheric boundary layer is a practical numerical predictive tool but requires parameterization of surface fluxes at the air-water interface. Current momentum flux parameterizations primarily use wave-phase adapting computational grids, incurring high computational costs, or use an equilibrium model based on Monin-Obukhov similarity theory for rough surfaces that cannot resolve wave phase information. To include wave phase-resolving physics at a cost similar to the equilibrium model, the Moving Surface Drag (MOSD) model is introduced. It assumes ideal airflow over locally piece-wise planar representations of moving water wave surfaces. Horizontally unresolved interactions are still modeled using the equilibrium model. Validation against experimental and numerical datasets with known monochromatic waves demonstrates the robustness and accuracy of the model in representing wave-induced impacts on mean velocity and Reynolds stress profiles. The model is formulated to be applicable to a broad range of wave fields and its ability to represent cross-swell and multiple wavelength cases is illustrated. Additionally, the model is applied to LES of a laboratory-scale fixed-bottom offshore wind turbine model, and the results are compared with wind tunnel experimental data. The LES with the MOSD model shows good agreement in wind-wave-wake interactions and phase-dependent physics at a low computational cost. The model's simplicity and minimal computational needs make it valuable for studying turbulent atmospheric-scale flows over the sea, particularly in offshore wind energy research.",

In comparison to pure glyceline, lithium admixture leads to a reduction of ionic conductivity, which is accompanied by a slowing down of the rotational dipolar motions. In contrast to pure glyceline, the ionic and dipolar dynamics become increasingly decoupled at low temperatures and obey a fractional Debye-Stokes-Einstein relation as previously found in other glass-forming liquids. The obtained results demonstrate the relevance of decoupling effects and of the glass transition for the technically relevant ionic conductivity of these solvents.",

Then considering the optical characteristic of nano-particles and using the SLS technique further, the size distribution can be measured accurately and is also consistent with the results measured using the TEM technique. Based on the size distribution obtained using the SLS or TEM technique and the relation between the static and hydrodynamic radii, all the expected and measured values of $g^{\\left( 2\\right) }\\left( \u03c4\\right) $ investigated are very well consistent.

The traditional particle information: apparent hydrodynamic radius and polydispersity index measured using the DLS technique are determined by the optical and hydrodynamic characteristics and size distribution together.

While Vision Language Models (VLM) have demonstrated remarkable performance in certain VQA benchmarks, they still lack capabilities in 3D spatial reasoning, such as recognizing quantitative relationships of physical objects like distances or size differences. We hypothesize that VLMs' limited spatial reasoning capability is due to the lack of 3D spatial knowledge in training data and aim to solve this problem by training VLMs with Internet-scale spatial reasoning data. To this end, we present a system to facilitate this approach. We first develop an automatic 3D spatial VQA data generation framework that scales up to 2 billion VQA examples on 10 million real-world images. We then investigate various factors in the training recipe, including data quality, training pipeline, and VLM architecture. Our work features the first internet-scale 3D spatial reasoning dataset in metric space. By training a VLM on such data, we significantly enhance its ability on both qualitative and quantitative spatial VQA. Finally, we demonstrate that this VLM unlocks novel downstream applications in chain-of-thought spatial reasoning and robotics due to its quantitative estimation capability.

All except our two layer models can match the planet's gravity field as measured by the Juno spacecraft. We find, however, that some model types are more plausible than others. In the best three layer models, for example, the transition from molecular to metallic hydrogen needs to be at ~500 GPa while theory and experiments place this transition at ~100 GPa. Four layer models with a single sharp boundary between core and mantle would be short-lived due to rapid convective core erosion. For this reason, we favor our five layer models that include a dilute core surrounded by a stably stratified core transition layer. Six layer models with a small compact core are also possible but with an upper limit of 3 Earth masses for such a compact core. All models assume a 1 bar temperature of 166.1 K, employ physical equations of state, and are constructed with the nonperturbative Concentric Maclaurin Spheroid (CMS) method. We analyze the convergence of this method and describe technical steps that are needed to make this technique so efficient that ensembles of models can be generated.",

Paradigmatic examples of the latter are the skin, the brain, and arterial walls, for which wiggly cross-sections are detected. Although experimental investigations on corrugation of these and analog bilayers would greatly benefit from scaling laws for prompt comparison of the wrinkling features, neither are they available nor have systematic approaches yielding to such laws ever been provided before. This gap is filled in this paper, where a uniaxially compressed bilayer formed by a thin elastic film bonded on a hyperelastic fiber-reinforced substrate is considered. The force balance at the film-substrate interface is here analytically and numerically investigated for highly mismatched film-substrates. The onset of wrinkling is then characterized in terms of both the critical strain and its corresponding wavenumber. Inspired by the asymptotic laws available for neo-Hookean bilayers, the paper then provides a systematic way to achieve novel scaling laws for the wrinkling features for fiber-reinforced highly mismatched hyperelastic bilayers. Such novel scaling laws shed light on the key contributions defining the response of the bilayer, as it is characterized by a fiber-induced complex anisotropy. Results are compared with Finite Element Analyses and also with outcomes of both existing linear models and available adhoc scalings. Furthermore, the amplitude, the global maximum and minimum of ruga occurring under increasing compression spanning the wrinkling, period doubling and folding regimes are also obtained.",

Recent studies have advanced the characterization and diagnosis of topology in Mott insulators whose underlying electronic structure is topologically nontrivial, through ``Green's function zeros\". However, their counterparts in metallic systems have yet to be explored. Here, we address this problem in an orbital-selective Mott phase (OSMP), which is of extensive interest to a variety of strongly correlated systems with a short-range Coulomb repulsion. We demonstrate symmetry protected crossing of the zeros in an OSMP. Utilizing the concept of Green's function Berry curvature, we show that the zero crossing has a quantized Berry flux. The resulting notion of Dirac zeros provides a window into the largely hidden landscape of topological zeros in strongly correlated metallic systems and, moreover, opens up a means to diagnose strongly correlated topology in new materials classes.",

For our calculations we used the parameters of a double layer of 1T$^\\prime$-MoS$_2$. Closed form analytical expressions are presented for the energy spectrum for excitons, their associated wave functions and binding energies. Additionally, we examine the effects which the intensity and frequency of circularly polarized irradiation has for 1T$^\\prime$-MoS$_2$ on the effective mass of the excitons since it has been demonstrated that the application of an external high-frequency dressing field tailors the crucial electronic including the exciton binding energy, as well as the critical temperature for superfluidity. We also calculate the sound velocity in the anisotropic weakly-interacting Bose gas of two-component indirect momentum space dark excitons for a double layer of 1T$^\\prime$-MoS$_2$. We show that the critical velocity of superfluidity, the spectrum of collective excitations, concentrations of the superfluid and normal component, and mean field critical temperature for superfluidity are anisotropic and formed by a two-component system. The critical temperature for superfluidity is increased when the exciton concentration and interlayer separation are increased.

GNSS ground-based networks are becoming denser, and the first stations installed have now quite long time-series that allow the study of the temporal features of water vapor and its relevant role inside the climate system. In this review, the different GNSS methodologies to retrieve atmospheric water vapor content re-examined, such as tomography, conversion of GNSS tropospheric delay to water vapor estimates, analyses of errors, and combinations of GNSS with other sources to enhance water vapor information. Moreover, the use of these data in different kinds of studies is discussed. For instance, the GNSS technique is commonly used as a reference tool for validating other water vapor products (e.g., radiosounding, radiometers onboard satellite platforms or ground-based instruments). Additionally, GNSS retrievals are largely used in order to determine the high spatio-temporal variability and long-term trends of atmospheric water vapor or in models with the goal of determining its notable influence on the climate system (e.g., assimilation in numerical prediction, as input to radiative transfer models, study of circulation patterns, etc.",

        "abstract": "Protoplanetary disks, which are the natural consequence of the gravitational collapse of the dense molecular cloud cores, host the formation of the planetary systems known today in our universe. Numerous efforts have been dedicated to investigate the properties of these disks in the more mature Class II stage, either by using numerical simulations of disk evolution from a limited range of initial conditions or by observations of their dust continuum and line emission from specific molecular tracers, and to compare the results from the two standpoints. Yet few studies have investigated the main limitations at work when measuring the embedded Class 0/I disk properties from observations, especially in a statistical fashion. In this study, we provide a first attempt to compare the accuracy of some critical disk parameters in Class 0/I systems, as derived on real ALMA observational data, with the corresponding physical parameters that modellers can directly define in numerical simulations. The approach we follow is to provide full post-processing of the numerical simulations and apply on the synthetic observations the same techniques used by observers to derive the physical parameters. To that end, we performed 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer and mock interferometric observations of the disk populations formed in an MHD simulation model of disk formation through the collapse of massive clumps with the tools RADMC-3D and CASA, respectively, to obtain their synthetic observations. With these observations, we re-employ the techniques commonly used in disk modelling from their continuum emissions to infer their properties that one would likely obtain if one observed them with real interferometers. We then demonstrate how their properties vary from the gas kinematics analyses to the dust continuum modelling.",

Indeed, this object is one of the ingredients needed for the construction of any variable flavour number (factorization) scheme at O(alphas^3). The construction of such scheme is crucial for the improvement of the accuracy of the extraction of the parton distribution functions from the experimental data, that in turn will provide an improvement of the accuracy of all the theoretical predictions in high energy physics.\n  Despite the function we are interested in is not known exactly, its expansion in some kinematic limits is available. In particular the high-scale limit (Q^2 >> m^2), high-energy limit (z->0, where z is the argument of the coefficient function) and threshold limit (z->zmax=1/(1+4m^2/Q^2)) of the exact coefficient function are all known, with the exception of some terms that we will provide in approximate form. Therefore, combining these limits in a proper way, we will construct an approximation for the unknown term of the N^3LO gluon coefficient function, that describes the exact curve in the whole range of z.\n  Since other approximations for the N^3LO gluon coefficient functions are present in the literature, we will conclude by comparing our final approximate coefficient functions with such approximations. We will show a comparison both for the NNLO, whose exact function is known, and for the N^3LO. With our approach, we expect our results to be more accurate than previous approximations, thus providing a sufficient precision for a complete description of DIS at N^3LO and the consequent determination of N^3LO PDFs.",

This approach constructs a low-dimensional model using only data and knowledge of the Hamiltonian function. Such ROMs can keep the intrinsic structure of the system, allowing them to capture the physics described by the governing equations. In this work, we extend this approach to more general systems that are either conservative or dissipative in energy, and which possess a gradient structure. We derive the optimization problems for inferring structure-preserving ROMs that preserve the gradient structure. We further derive an {\\em a priori} error estimate for the reduced-order approximation. To test the algorithms, we consider semi-discretized partial differential equations with gradient structure, such as the parameterized wave and Korteweg-de-Vries equations in the conservative case and the one- and two-dimensional Allen-Cahn equations in the dissipative case. The numerical results illustrate the accuracy, structure-preservation properties, and predictive capabilities of the gradient-preserving Operator Inference ROMs.",

Its dynamics are naturally continuous and described by a set of ordinary differential equations that have been proven to be useful for the optimization of continuous variables non-convex quadratic optimization problems. The dynamics of such Continuous Variable CIMs (CV-CIM) encourage optimization via optical pulses whose amplitudes are determined by the negative gradient of the objective; however, standard gradient descent is known to be trapped by local minima and hampered by poor problem conditioning. In this work, we propose to modify the CV-CIM dynamics using more sophisticated pulse injections based on tried-and-true optimization techniques such as momentum and Adam. Through numerical experiments, we show that the momentum and Adam updates can significantly speed up the CV-CIM's convergence and improve sample diversity over the original CV-CIM dynamics. We also find that the Adam-CV-CIM's performance is more stable as a function of feedback strength, especially on poorly conditioned instances, resulting in an algorithm that is more robust, reliable, and easily tunable. More broadly, we identify the CIM dynamical framework as a fertile opportunity for exploring the intersection of classical optimization and modern analog computing.",

In contrast to these expectations, we here find unpredictable, transiently chaotic dynamics induced by SOT at an artificial anisotropy-engineered defect in a magnetic racetrack. Based on these controlled conditions, we directly observe the nanoscale dynamics with holography-based, time-resolved x-ray imaging. In concert with micromagnetic simulations, we disclose a regime of violent picosecond fluctuations, including topological instabilities that, remarkably, result in deterministic final configurations. In addition, our images expose previously unseen skyrmion shedding and highlight the potential of transiently chaotic pathways for topological switching. Our approach offers new perspectives for the investigation and application of highly non-linear SOT dynamics in spintronics materials.",

Here, we tackle this limitation by harnessing a machine-learning surrogate model to qualitatively explore the defect structural landscape. By learning defect motifs in a family of related metal chalcogenide and mixed anion crystals, the model successfully predicts favourable reconstructions for unseen defects in unseen compositions for 90% of cases, thereby reducing the number of first-principles calculations by 73%. Using CdSe$_x$Te$_{1-x}$ alloys as an exemplar, we train a model on the end member compositions and apply it to find the stable geometries of all inequivalent vacancies for a range of mixing concentrations, thus enabling more accurate and faster defect studies for configurational complex systems.",

Taking inspiration from biophotonic systems in nature, we introduce a new class of hybrid metasurfaces, which combine ordered and disordered elements. While the ordered phase relies on non-reciprocal meta-atoms - whose breaking of the out-of-plane symmetry enables the confinement of visible light in air, the disordered phase exploits global plasmonic network modes and their ability to localize energy at nanometric scales. By generating configurable structural colors with extra-ordinary resolution, we demonstrate that coupling of these elements provides a new dimension in the design space. We showcase that control of the local light-matter interaction enables the creation of intricate, customizable optical patterns, which open new avenues for information encoding and high-security features.",

Following the precepts of information theory, entropy is measured in bits, and coincides with information capacity at thermodynamic equilibrium. Consequently, not only is the temperature of an equilibrated system expressed in J/bit, but it acquires an operational meaning: It is the cost in energy to increase its information capacity by 1 bit. Our proposal also supports the notion of available capacity, analogous to free energy. Finally, it simplifies Landauer's cost and clarifies that it is a cost of displacement, not of erasure.",

In this work, we demonstrate an approach to control the direction of active droplet propulsion by a photoresponsive cholesteric liquid crystal environment. The active droplet represents a water dispersion of bacterial B. subtilis microswimmers. When placed in a cholesteric, a surfactant-stabilized active droplet distorts the local director field, producing a point defect-hedgehog, which breaks the fore-aft symmetry. The chaotic motion of the bacteria inside the droplet is rectified into directional motion by the asymmetric director field outside the droplet. When the pitch of the cholesteric is altered by visible light irradiation, the asymmetry axis and thus the droplet trajectory realign along a new direction. Droplets realign counterclockwise on exposure to light of 535 nm, and clockwise on exposure to light of 450 nm, as dictated by the photoinduced change in the handedness of the cholesteric. The strategy allows for a non-contact dynamic control of active droplets trajectories and demonstrates the advantage of orientationally ordered media in control of active matter over their isotropic counterparts.",

This study introduces weak first- and second-order solvers for the ISE based on directly applying the It\u00f4-Taylor expansion with exact derivatives in the interaction picture. We tested the method on free and driven Morse oscillators coupled to a thermal environment and found that both orders allowed practical estimation with a few dozen iterations. The variance was relatively small compared to the linear unraveling and did not grow with time. The second-order solver delivers much higher accuracy and stability with bigger time steps than the first-order scheme, with a small additional workload. However, the second-order algorithm has quadratic complexity with the number of Lindblad operators as opposed to the linear complexity of the first-order algorithm.",

We do so both for the case in which the evolution is unitary and when it is subjected to dissipative effects. These models offer a comprehensive quantum description of an anharmonic system interacting with a single mode of the electromagnetic field within a perfect or dissipative cavity, respectively. In the dissipative model, the non-unitary effects arise from dephasing, relaxation, and decay of the transmon coupled to its environment.

To be more specific, we derive linear bounds $d_-\u0394{E}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\leq \u0394Q \\leq d_+ \u0394\u0394{E}_{\\mathbf{w}}$ on the errors $\u0394Q $ of these sought-after quantities. A subsequent analytical analysis and numerical illustration proves the tightness of our universal inequalities. Our results and particularly the explicit form of $d_{\\pm}\\equiv d_{\\pm}^{(Q)}(\\mathbf{w},\\mathbf{E})$ provide valuable insights into the optimal choice of the auxiliary weights $w_k$ in practical applications.",

We rationalize these results as features of a developing transient flow of a viscoelastic solution in space and time and show that these shear layers indicate a flow induced heterogeneity.

The quantum fluctuations of the monopole field are described effectively by a strongly-coupled ``dual'' $U_{\\rm d}(1)$ gauge field, which is independent of the electromagnetic $U_{\\rm em}(1)$ gauge field. The effective interactions of the charged matter with the monopole source are described by a gauge invariant mixed Chern-Simons-like (Pontryagin-density) term between the two $U(1)$ gauge fields. The latter interaction coupling is left free, and a Lattice study of the system is performed with the aim of determining the phase structure of this effective theory. Our study shows that, in the spontaneously-broken-symmetry phase, the monopole source triggers, via the mixed Chern-Simons term, which is non-trivial in its presence, the generation of a dynamical singular configuration (magnetic-monopole-like) for the respective gauge fields. The scalar field also behaves in the broken phase in a way similar to that of the scalar sector of the `t Hooft-Polyakov monopole.",

Quantum algorithms addressing this problem have hitherto been constrained to special normal matrices assuming spectral decomposition, leaving the extension to general matrices an open challenge. In this work, we present a novel family of quantum algorithms tailored for solving the eigenvalue problem for general matrices, encompassing scenarios with complex eigenvalues or even defective matrices. Our approach begins by tackling the task of searching for an eigenvalue without additional constraints. For diagonalizable matrices, our algorithm has $\\tilde O(\\varepsilon^{-1})$ complexity with an error $\\varepsilon$, achieving the nearly Heisenberg scaling. Subsequently, we study the identification of eigenvalues closest to a specified point or line, extending the results for ground energy and energy gap problems in Hermitian matrices. We achieve an accuracy scaling of $\\tilde O(\\varepsilon^{-2})$ for general diagonalizable matrices, further refining to $\\tilde O(\\varepsilon^{-1})$ under the condition of real eigenvalues or constant distance from the reference point. The algorithm's foundation lies in the synergy of three techniques: the relationship between eigenvalues of matrix $A$ and the minimum singular value of $A-\u03bcI$, quantum singular value threshold subroutine extended from quantum singular-value estimation, and problem-specific searching algorithms. Our algorithms find applications in diverse domains, including estimating the relaxation time of Markov chains, solving Liouvillian gaps in open quantum systems, and verifying PT-symmetry broken/unbroken phases. These applications underscore the significance of our quantum eigensolvers for problems across various disciplines.",

Quantum machine learning algorithms offer a promising avenue to overcome these limitations but bring along their own challenges.

Challenges associated with ion trap-coupled classical processor are addressed, highlighting the robustness of the genetic algorithm as a classical optimizer in navigating complex optimization landscape inherent in binary classification problems with many local minima. Experimental results, focused on a binary classification problem, reveal the superior efficiency and accuracy of the genetic algorithm compared to gradient-based optimizers. We intricately discuss why gradient-based optimizers may not be suitable in the NISQ era through thorough analysis. These findings contribute insights into the performance of quantum-classical hybrid systems, emphasizing the significance of efficient training strategies and hardware considerations for practical quantum machine learning applications. This work not only advances the understanding of hybrid quantum-classical systems but also underscores the potential impact on real-world challenges through the convergence of quantum and classical computing paradigms operating without the aid of classical simulators.",

Magnetite is a material of great importance in paleomagnetic studies and magnetic hyperthermia but existing estimates of the attempt frequency $f_0$ vary by several orders of magnitude in the range $10^7-10^{13}$ Hz, leading to significant uncertainty in their relaxation rate. Here we present a dynamical method enabling full parameterization of the Arrhenius-N\u00e9el law using atomistic spin dynamics. We determine the temperature and volume dependence of the attempt frequency of magnetite nanoparticles with cubic anisotropy and find a value of $f_0 = 0.562 \\pm 0.059$ GHz at room temperature. For particles with enhanced anisotropy we find a significant increase in the attempt frequency and a strong temperature dependence suggesting an important role of anisotropy. The method is applicable to a wide range of dynamical systems where different states can be clearly identified and enables robust estimates of domain state stabilities, with particular importance in the rapidly developing field of micromagnetic analysis of paleomagnetic recordings where samples can be numerically reconstructed to provide a better understanding of geomagnetic recording fidelity over geological time scales.",

The generalized Newman-Unti gauge includes algebraically special condition in its most convenient form. Remarkably, the generic solutions satisfying the algebraically special condition truncate in the inverse power of radial expansions and the non-radial Newman-Penrose equations are explicitly solved at any order. Hence, we provide the most general algebraically special solution space and the derivation is self-contained in the Newman-Penrose formalism. The asymptotic symmetry with respect to the algebraically special condition is the standard Weyl-BMS symmetry and the symmetry parameters consist only the integration constant order.

While polarised discussions can exhibit significant distrust in the news, it is still largely unclear whether disagreement is somehow linked to misinformation. In this work, we exploit the results of `Cartesio', an online experiment to rate the trustworthiness of Italian news articles annotated for reliability by expert evaluators. We developed a metric for disagreement that allows for correct comparisons between news with different mean trust values. Our findings indicate that, though misinformation receives lower trust ratings than accurate information, it does not appear to be more controversial. Additionally, we examined the relationship between these findings and Facebook user engagement with news articles. Our results show that disagreement correlates with an increased likelihood of commenting, probably linked to inconclusive and long discussions. The emerging scenario is one in which fighting disinformation seems ineffective in countering polarisation. Disagreement focuses more on the divergence of opinions, trust, and their effects on social cohesion. This study offers a foundation for unsupervised news item analysis independent of expert annotation. Incorporating similar principles into the design of news distribution platforms and social media systems can enhance online interactions and foster the development of a less divisive news ecosystem.",

The proposed method performs better than existing methods by several orders of magnitude for a range of structurally diverse complex networks, both in terms of the number of iterations taken, and time taken to reach a given assortativity value.

The simultaneous presence of polarons and defects, and their complex interactions, pose challenges for first-principles simulations and experimental techniques. In this study, we leverage machine learning and a first-principles database to analyze the distribution of surface oxygen vacancies (V$_{\\rm O}$) and induced small polarons on rutile TiO$_2$(110), effectively disentangling the interactions between polarons and defects. By combining neural-network supervised learning and simulated annealing, we elucidate the inhomogeneous V$_{\\rm O}$ distribution observed in scanning probe microscopy (SPM). Our innovative approach allows us to understand and predict defective surface patterns at previously inaccessible length scales, identifying the specific role of individual types of defects. Specifically, surface-polaron-stabilizing V$_{\\rm O}$-configurations are identified, which could have consequences for surface reactivity.",

        "abstract": "Certifying whether an arbitrary quantum system is entangled or not, is, in general, an NP-hard problem. Though various necessary and sufficient conditions have already been explored in this regard for lower dimensional systems, it is hard to extend them to higher dimensions. Recently, an ensemble bagging and convex hull approximation (CHA) approach (together, BCHA) was proposed and it strongly suggests employing a machine learning technique for the separability-entanglement classification problem. However, BCHA does only incorporate the balanced dataset for classification tasks which results in lower average accuracy. In order to solve the data imbalance problem in the present literature, an exploration of the Boosting technique has been carried out, and a trade-off between the Boosting and Bagging-based ensemble classifier is explored for quantum separability problems. For the two-qubit and two-qutrit quantum systems, the pros and cons of the proposed random under-sampling boost CHA (RUSBCHA) for the quantum separability problem are compared with the state-of-the-art CHA and BCHA approaches. As the data is highly unbalanced, performance measures such as overall accuracy, average accuracy, F-measure, and G-mean are evaluated for a fair comparison. The outcomes suggest that RUSBCHA is an alternative to the BCHA approach. Also, for several cases, performance improvements are observed for RUSBCHA since the data is imbalanced.",

Here, we proposed a term of pseudo-polarization to reveal topological nature of radiation asymmetry in bilayer metagratings. Robust pseudo-polarization vortex with an integer topological charge exists in P-symmetry metagrating, allowing for tunable directionality ranging from -1 to 1 in synthetic parameter space. When P-symmetry-breaking, such vortex becomes pairs of C points due to the conservation law of charge, leading to the phase difference of radiation asymmetry from \u03c0/2 to 3\u03c0/2. Furthermore, topologically enabled coherent perfect absorption is robust with customized phase difference at will between two counter-propagating external light sources. This work can not only enrich the understanding of two particular topological photonic behavriors, i.e., bound state in the continuum and unidirectional guided resonance, but also provide a topological view on radiation asymmetry, opening an unexplored avenue for asymmetric light manipulation in on-chip laser, light-light switch and quantum emitters.",

We consider and analyze different scenarios based on how many particles are accessible. In each scenario, we evaluate first-order coherence, concurrence fill, and global concurrence under varying Hawking temperature and Dirac particle mode frequency. For the fully accessible scenario with all particles outside the event horizon, the measures exhibit non-monotonic behavior with a discernible trade-off. In the partially accessible scenarios with one particle inside the event horizon, monotonic variations and clear trade-offs are observed. Finally, in the scenario when two particles are inside the event horizon, concurrence fill becomes complex, attributed to the violation of the entanglement polygon inequality in curved space-time. This result reveals intricate relationships between entanglement and coherence around the event horizon of Schwarzchild black holes. Our findings suggest reevaluating entanglement polygon inequalities and concurrence fill for applicability in flat and curved space-times. These insights contribute to our understanding of quantum information dynamics and gravitational impacts on entanglement in extreme environments.",

Recently published all-atom simulations of $\u03b1$3D by the Shaw group reveal that lowering the pH significantly reduces both native and non-native salt-bridge interactions, which dominate the folding dynamics. Here, we demonstrate that this physiochemical modulation directly perturbs the folding friction, which we evaluate using non-Markovian memory-kernel-extraction techniques. In doing so, we find that the reduction in pH not only decreases the magnitude of the time-dependent friction acting on the protein but also more dramatically shortens the time scale of the friction memory effects. As a result, the folding dynamics in the low pH system are well described by a purely Markovian model. In the neutral pH system, however, the memory time scale is of the same order as the folding time and is accelerated by a factor of 6 compared to a Markovian model prediction. We demonstrate that this memory-induced barrier-crossing speed-up is predicted by non-Markovian reaction-kinetic theories, confirming that non-Markovian models are, in general, necessary for a quantitative description of protein folding dynamics.",

Nevertheless, much of the earlier work in merging these two sensory modalities has relied on supervised methods utilizing datasets labeled by humans.This paper introduces MViTac, a novel methodology that leverages contrastive learning to integrate vision and touch sensations in a self-supervised fashion. By availing both sensory inputs, MViTac leverages intra and inter-modality losses for learning representations, resulting in enhanced material property classification and more adept grasping prediction. Through a series of experiments, we showcase the effectiveness of our method and its superiority over existing state-of-the-art self-supervised and supervised techniques. In evaluating our methodology, we focus on two distinct tasks: material classification and grasping success prediction. Our results indicate that MViTac facilitates the development of improved modality encoders, yielding more robust representations as evidenced by linear probing assessments.",

An increase in walking speed resulted in a corresponding decrease in raindrop and snowflake collisions. When raindrops or snowflakes were given a horizontal movement vector due to wind, a local minimum in collisions was achieved when moving in parallel with the same horizontal speed as the raindrop; no local minimum was detected with antiparallel movement.

However, the origin and characteristics of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays remain elusive, making them a crucial topic of exploration in the field of astroparticle physics. Currently, our examination of these cosmic rays relies on studying the extensive air showers (EAS) generated as they interact with atmospheric nuclei during their passage through Earth's atmosphere. Accurate comprehension of cosmic ray composition is vital in determining their source. Notably, the muon content of EAS and the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum serve as the most significant indicators of primary mass composition. In this study, we present two novel methods for reconstructing particle densities based on muon counts obtained from underground muon detectors (UMDs) at varying distances to the shower axis. Our methods were analyzed using Monte Carlo air shower simulations. To demonstrate these techniques, we utilized the muon content measurements from the UMD of the Pierre Auger cosmic ray Observatory, an array of detectors dedicated to measuring extensive air showers. Our newly developed reconstruction methods, employed with two distinct UMD data acquisition modes, showcased minimal bias and standard deviation. Furthermore, we conducted a comparative analysis of our approaches against previously established methodologies documented in existing literature.",

This work aims to explore the melting heat transfer characteristics of salty ice in a square cavity filled with homogeneous porous media subjected to lateral heating. In order to facilitate the visualization of melting dynamics in a uniform porous media, a three-dimensional (3D) printed transparent cavity filled with porous matrix was manufactured, featuring an open upper end. Aqueous solutions of sodium chloride at concentration both higher and lower than the eutectic concentration were investigated. Lateral heating experiments with constant heat flux were conducted in a subzero temperature environment. The effect of heating power, initial concentrations and different sizes of porous matrix was investigated. Distinct phenomena were observed based on the concentration of the aqueous solution. Specifically, the concentration lower than the eutectic concentration results in an upward bending melting interface. Whereas the concentration surpassing the eutectic concentration resulted in a downward bending melting interface. In the presence of salt, a melting convex appears at the bottom of the melting interface and manifests during the whole melting process. Notably, smaller matrix enables faster melting rate. Furthermore, three distinct stages were revealed in our experiments, characterized as conduction, mixture of conduction and ultimately convection stage. The correlations for Nu and the average propagation rate of mushy/liquid interface were established by order of magnitude analysis and fit well with the experiments.",

        "abstract": "A lattice QCD calculation for the four gluon one-particle irreducible Green function in the Landau gauge is discussed. Results for some of the associated form factors are reported for kinematical configurations with a single momentum scale. Our results show that the computation of this Green function requires large statistical ensembles with 10K or larger number of gauge configurations. The simulations considered herein have a clear Monte Carlo signal for momenta up to $\\sim 1$ GeV. The form factors show an hierarchy, with the form factor associated with the tree level Feynman rule being dominant and essentially constant for the range of momenta accessed. The remaining form factors seem to increase as the momentum decreases, suggesting that a possible $\\log$ divergence may occur. The computed form factors are, at least, in qualitative agreement with the results obtained with continuum approaches to this vertex, when available.",

Here, we report a study of quantum oscillations (QOs) in a weakly coupled double layer system, composed of a large angle twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG). We observe two different QOs at low temperature, one with a periodicity in carrier density (n), i.e. Shubnikov de Haas oscillation (SdHO) due to Landau quantization, and the other one in displacement field (D), resulting a grid pattern. We quantify the interlayer coupling strength by measuring the interlayer capacitance from the grid pattern with a capacitance model, revealing an electron hole asymmetry. At high temperature when SdHO are thermal smeared, we observe resistance peaks when LLs from two minivalleys in the moir\u00e9 Brillion zone are aligned, regardless of carrier density; eventually, it results in a two fold increase of oscillating frequency in D, serving as a smoking gun evidence of the magneto intersubband oscillations (MISO) in a double layer system. The temperature dependence of MISO suggests electron-electron interaction between two minivalleys play a crucial rule in the scattering, and the scattering times obtained from MISO thermal damping are found to be correlated with the interlayer coupling strength. Our study reveals an intriguing interplay among Landau quantization, moir\u00e9 band structure, and scatterings.",

This robustness is crucial as it enables, amongst others, using microscope objectives with short working distances to perform wide field imaging/sensing with bulk diamonds. The antenna generates a magnetic field strength of 22.3 A/m for 1 W total driving power, which doubles the power efficiency compared with previously reported patch antenna designs. The magnetic field homogeneity in a volume of $1 \\text{mm}^3$ is within 6.6\\%. The antenna has a full width at half maximum bandwidth of $\\sim$160 MHz and its resonant frequency can be tuned over a 400 MHz range via four capacitors or varactors. The antenna has been tested and found to remain within safe handling temperatures during continuous-wave operation at 8 W. The files required to reproduce this antenna, which can be built on a standard and affordable double sided PCB, are provided open-source. This work facilitates a robust and versatile piece of instrumentation, being particularly appealing for applications such as high sensitivity magnetometry and wide field imaging/sensing with Nitrogen Vacancy centers.",

Optical characterization such as photoluminescence and Raman spectroscopies are important tools to probe their physical properties and the impact of defects. However, conventional optical techniques present a spatial resolution limitation lying in a $\u03bc$m-scale, which can be overcomed by the use of near-field optical measurements. Here, we use tip-enhanced photoluminescence and Raman spectroscopies to unveil nanoscale optical heterogeneities at grain boundaries, local strain fields and edges in grown MoS$_{2}$ monolayers. A noticeable enhancement of the exciton peak intensity corresponding to a trion emission quenching is observed at narrow regions down to 47 nm of width at grain boundaries related to doping effects. Besides, localized strain fields inside the sample lead to non-uniformities in the intensity and energy position of photoluminescence peaks. Finally, distinct samples present different nano-optical responses at their edges due to strain and passivation defects. The passivated defective edges show a photoluminescence intensity enhancement and energy blueshift as well as a frequency blueshift of the 2LA Raman mode. On the other hand, the strained edges display a photoluminescence energy redshift and frequency redshifts for E$_{2g}$ and 2LA Raman modes. Our work shows that different defect features can be only probed by using optical spectroscopies with a nanometric resolution, thus revealing hindered local impact of different nanoscale defects in two-dimensional materials.",

We then deduce equivalent conditions for the injectivity of the parity transformation on any subset of all equivalences classes of graphs. Moreover, we show concrete examples of optimization problems demonstrating that the parity transformation is not an injective mapping, and also introduce an important class of plaquette layouts and their corresponding set of constraints whose preimage is uniquely determined.

To enable data-centric approaches to materials discovery, allow efficient storage of microstructural data and assist in quality control in metals processing, we require more complete descriptors of microstructure. The concept of microstructural fingerprinting, using machine learning (ML) to develop quantitative, low-dimensional descriptors of microstructures, has recently attracted significant attention. However, it is difficult to interpret conclusions drawn by ML algorithms, which are commonly referred to as \"black boxes\".\n  Here we explore variational autoencoders (VAEs), which can be trained to produce microstructural fingerprints in a continuous latent space. VAEs enable the reconstruction of images from fingerprints, allowing us to explore how key features of microstructure are encoded. We develop a VAE architecture based on ResNet18 and train it on Ti-6Al-4V optical micrographs as an example of an industrially important alloy where microstructural control is critical to performance. The latent space is explored in several ways, including by supplying interpolated and randomly perturbed fingerprints to the trained decoder and via dimensionality reduction to explore the distribution of microstructural features within the latent space of fingerprints. We show that the VAE fingerprints exhibit smooth, interpolable behaviour with stability to local perturbations, supporting their suitability as general purpose descriptors for microstructure. We also show that key properties of the microstructures are strongly correlated with position in the latent space, supporting the use of VAE fingerprints for quantitative exploration of process-structure-property relationships.",

Instead of using wave functions or density operators on Hilbert spaces, tomograms, which are the true pdfs, are used to completely describe the states of quantum systems. Unlike quasi-pdfs, like the Wigner function, tomograms can be analysed using all the tools of classical probability theory for pdf estimation, which can allow a better quality of state reconstruction. This is particularly useful when dealing with non-Gaussian states where the pdfs are multi-mode. The knowledge of the family of distributions plays an important role in the application of both parametric and non-parametric density estimation methods. We show that not all pdfs can play the role of tomograms of quantum states and introduce the conditions that must be fulfilled by pdfs to be \"quantum\".",

The emergence of topological and normal insulating phases is assessed based on the evolution of the charge carrier densities, the resistivity dependence of the gap via in-plane magnetic fields and the thermal activation of carriers. For the Hall bar device tuned optically, we observe the fingerprints associated with the presence of only the topological insulating phase. For another Hall bar processed identically but with an additional top gate, the coexistence of normal and topological insulating phases is found by electrical tuning. Our finding paves the way for utilizing a new electro-optical tuning scheme to manipulate InAs/GaSb bilayer quantum wells to obtain trivial-topological insulating interfaces in the bulk rather than at the physical edge of the device.",

It is usually applied in calculations in regular Quantum-Electrodynamics (QED), but it is particularly interesting to be employed in the framework of pseudo-QED (PQED), where fermions are constrained to 2+1 dimensions while external fields interacting with these fermions live in the bulk of a 3+1 space. In this context, the gauge parameter can be adjusted to match the power of the external momentum in the denominator of the photon propagator, simplifying the infrared region without the need of a photon mass. In this work we apply for the first time this machinery to PQED, generalizing the procedure to calculate the self energy in arbitrary dimensions, allowing of course for different dimensionality of fermions and gauge fields.",

We study the stability and instability of elliptic-function periodic waves with respect to subharmonic perturbations, whose period is a multiple of the period of the elliptic waves. We thus find the modulational instability (MI) of the corresponding dnoidal waves. Upon varying parameters of dnoidal waves, spectrally unstable ones can be transformed into stable states via the Hamiltonian Hopf bifurcation. For snoidal waves, we find a transition of the dominant instability scenario between the MI and instability with a bubble-like spectrum. For cnoidal waves, we produce three variants of the MI. Evolution of the unstable states is also considered, leading to formation of rogue waves on top of the elliptic-wave and continuous-wave backgrounds.",

A defining feature of the MITgcm is that it has been developed to be compatible with an algorithmic differentiation (AD) tool, TAF, enabling the generation of tangent-linear and adjoint models. These provide gradient information which enables dynamics-based sensitivity and attribution studies, state and parameter estimation, and rigorous uncertainty quantification. Importantly, gradient information is essential for computing comprehensive sensitivities and performing efficient large-scale data assimilation, ensuring that observations collected from satellites and in-situ measuring instruments can be effectively used to optimize a large uncertain control space. As a result, the MITgcm forms the dynamical core of a key data assimilation product employed by the physical oceanography research community: Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) state estimate. Although MITgcm and ECCO are used extensively within the research community, the AD tool TAF is proprietary and hence inaccessible to a large proportion of these users. The new version 2 (MITgcm-AD v2) framework introduced here is based on the source-to-source AD tool Tapenade, which has recently been open-sourced. Another feature of Tapenade is that it stores required variables by default (instead of recomputing them) which simplifies the implementation of efficient, AD-compatible code. The framework has been integrated with the MITgcm model main branch and is now freely available.",

One-photon polymerization is a key process in this advancement, standing out for rapid printing time, albeit with limited resolution. Two-photon polymerization (2PP) empowers AM with unprecedented resolution but is accompanied by a tradeoff of prolonged printing times. We propose combining the single-photon absorption (1PA) and 2PP to benefit from the dual capabilities, allowing for faster printing while maintaining high resolution and improved depth sectioning, respectively. In this study, we employ a blue light source to pre-excite a photocurable resin by 1PA followed by a precisely focused femtosecond (fs) beam to provide the missing energy necessary to reach the polymerization threshold to solidify the resin through two-photon absorption. First, we investigate the impact of pre-sensitization by blue light illumination on 2PP and demonstrate one order of magnitude faster printing time for a voxel size of 150 nm as compared to the same voxel size printed by 2PP only. Then, we build a custom 2PP printer utilizing blue light sensitization in a light-sheet mode and demonstrate successful 3D prints.",

Both methods are applied to the magnetic geometry of the DIII-D tokamak, as well as the Helically Symmetric eXperiment (HSX) and Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarators. Here we analytically investigate the influence of collisions on the TEM eigenmode frequency by a perturbative approach with an energy-dependent Krook operator. A universal finding for all geometries is a stabilisation of the growth rate at high collisionality, the rate of which, however, depends on the geometry. At low collisionality, a growth rate insensitive to the collisionality is obtained in DIII-D at all wavenumbers, and for high-wavenumber modes in HSX and W7-X. In contrast, for the low-wavenumber modes in HSX and W7-X a destabilisation is obtained. Linear gyrokinetic simulations for the same geometries confirm these qualitative trends. Additionally, the simulations show the destabilisation of the low-wavenumber modes in HSX and W7-X is a result of a collision-induced transition of the dominant mode towards the Universal Instability (UI), a trend which is also continued to high-wavenumbers in W7-X.",

By employing this approach, we gain novel insights into the geometry and dynamics of photon surfaces, independent of the global spacetime structure. We first discuss the photon surface conditions in a Petrov type-D spacetime manifold, and then we simplify those conditions assuming the existence of spherical symmetry. Finally, employing the simplified, spherically symmetric photon surface conditions, we explore the dynamics of photon surfaces in static, collapsing Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) spacetimes, and Vaidya spacetimes. Notably, we show that photon surfaces can emerge from the central singularity during the collapse of an inhomogeneous dust cloud modeled by a LTB spacetime. This underscores the significance of our findings in comprehending the potential observational implications of the physics near the ultra-high gravity region.",

This observation allows one to characterize, for a generic adiabatic evolution, the average dynamics of the open system. However, information about fluctuations of dynamical observables, such as the number of photons emitted or the time-integrated stochastic entropy production in single experimental runs, requires controlling the whole spectrum of the generator and not only the stationary state. Here, we show how such information can be obtained in adiabatic open quantum dynamics by exploiting tools from large deviation theory. We prove an adiabatic theorem for deformed generators, which allows us to encode, in a biased quantum state, the full counting statistics of generic time-integrated dynamical observables. We further compute the probability associated with an arbitrary \"rare\" time-history of the observable and derive a dynamics which realizes it in its typical behavior. Our results provide a way to characterize and engineer adiabatic open quantum dynamics and to control their fluctuations.",

All possible decays of the leptoquarks into quarks of the third generation and charged or neutral leptons of any generation are investigated. Since no significant deviations from the Standard Model expectation are observed in any of the individual analyses, combined exclusion limits are set on the production cross-sections for scalar and vector leptoquarks.
